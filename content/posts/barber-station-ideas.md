The formation of ideas
When it comes to the formation of ideas, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, it’s important to be aware of your own biases and assumptions. We all have them, and they can distort the way we see the world and the ideas we come up with.
It’s also important to be open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives. When you’re stuck in your own bubble, it’s easy to get tunnel vision and miss out on good ideas. But if you’re willing to step outside of your comfort zone and listen to other people, you might just be surprised by what you come up with.

Finally, don’t be afraid to experiment. Trying new things is how we learn and grow, so don’t be afraid to take risks.

Creativeblocking: What is it and how can it help you be more creative?
Creativeblocking is a term that has been mentioned in a few places, but mostly as an afterthought. Most people seem to think of it as a thing that happens to creatives when they try to do something new or different, and it takes up space in their brain. But what is creativeblocking really? Is it something that you have to experience for yourself to understand, or can it be learned? Here are 8 things you need to know about creativeblocking if you want to be more creative: 
1) It starts with setting your boundary
