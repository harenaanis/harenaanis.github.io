Introduce the topic of inventions.
Inventions are ideas or objects that are created with the purpose of solving a problem or making life easier. Inventors are people who come up with these ideas and create them.
Some inventions are world-changing, like the telephone or the airplane. Others solve more everyday problems, like a better mousetrap or a self-tying shoelace. No matter how big or small, all inventions start with an idea.

If you have an invention idea, the first step is to figure out if it’s something that people actually need or want. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to start working on making your invention a reality.

Conclusion: Is a DIY project right for you?
A do-it-yourself project can be a great way to save money, but it’s not right for everyone. Here are some things to consider before starting a DIY project.
Time: A DIY project will take longer than hiring a professional, so be sure you have the time to commit.

Cost: The initial cost of a DIY project may be cheaper, but if you make mistakes, it can end up costing more in the long run.

Skill Level: Not all projects are created equal. Some are much easier than others. Be honest with yourself about your skill level and whether or not you can handle the project.

Tools and Materials: You’ll need more than just a few tools and materials for most projects. Make sure you have everything you need before starting.
