Conclusion: What are the benefits and challenges of big ideas?
Big ideas are a time-tested way to solve unique problems. They're also a challenge to create because they often require a new perspective and an innovative approach to what's already been tried. While big ideas can have significant benefits, there are also risks associated with them, which can influence their success or failure. Here are three key Takeaways from the past several years of big idea development: 
1. Big ideas can be successful if they're based on sound principles and backed up by research.
2. The risks associated with big ideas can impact their success or failure, and those risks need to be considered when developing them.
3. A big idea needs to be well thought out and supported by others in order for it to become reality.
