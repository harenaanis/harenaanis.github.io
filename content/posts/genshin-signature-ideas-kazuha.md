Waste Management: How do you deal with waste when completing a DIY project?
Do you have any extra materials or tools that you don't need and could use on a future project? Do you have old clothes, furniture, or other materials that you don't want to throw away but can't seem to get rid of? If so, there are a few ways to deal with waste when completing a DIY project. 
One way is to bin the material and put it in a landfill. This option is often cheaper and takes less time than dealing with the waste physically. Another option is to recycle the material. This process involves sorting the material by type (paper, plastics, metal) and then putting it into appropriate jars or sacks. The recycling process can take weeks or even months, but it is usually cheaper than trying to get rid of the material physically.

The final word: What is the most important thing you can learn from your experiences with developing and implementing big ideas?
Big ideas are a staple in business and life, but they can be difficult to implement. Here are three tips for developing big ideas:
1. Be prepared to fail. The most important thing you can learn from your experiences with big ideas is that it’s not always easy or straightforward to reach your goals. Don’t be discouraged – look for ways to overcome any obstacles and reach your destination.

2. Take the time to analyze your success rates. It can be helpful to track how often you achieve your goals with big ideas compared to other projects you’ve worked on in the past. This will give you a better understanding of what works and what doesn’t when it comes time to put big ideas into practice.

3. Be persistent.
