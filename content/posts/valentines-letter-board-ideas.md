Invention Process: How does one become an inventor?
Invention is a process that one can become an inventor by understanding how it works and then coming up with a new invention. There are many ways to become an inventor, but the most common way is through research. Research can be done in many ways, including studying science and technology, reading books, listening to lectures, and even creating your own inventions. The most important thing is to be passionate about your invention and keep working on it until you have a great idea for a product or service.

Examples of creativity: Music, art, fashion, cooking, gardening, writing
Creativity is everywhere. Whether it’s in the creative minds behind design, the creativity that goes into making music or art, or simply how people approach their every day tasks, creativity is always at work. However, what we often don’t consider is how creativity manifests itself in our everyday lives. For example, when you go to a restaurant and see all of the different items on the menu, do you think about the creativity that went into designing and coming up with a plan for each dish? Or when you walk through your neighborhood and see all of the different houses, are you thinking about how much creativity went into picking out the right one for your home? In both cases, there was a lot of thought put into it. And just as importantly, both examples have had an impact on people who have tasted them.

How does brainstroming work?
There is much debate surrounding the impact of brainstroming on cognitive functions, but there is little known about how it works. A recent study by scientists at the University of Utah found that when subjects are exposed to a burst of stimulation their brains release neurochemical substances that improve their cognitive performance. The study also showed that the release of these neurochemical substances was associated with increased activity in areas of the brain responsible for memory and attention.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a big help when it comes to solving problems. Ideas can also help you see things in a new light or come up with new ideas for projects. There are many benefits to having ideas and some people swear by the power of them. Here are three reasons why you should try out ideas at least once: 
- When you have an idea, it can force you to think about what else could be done. This can lead to new ideas, which in turn can lead to new projects. 
- Ideas are often more efficient than what is currently being done. When you have an idea, you can get started on it even if it’s not perfect and that makes the process of learning more efficient. 
- Ideas give people the opportunity to share their thoughts and opinions with others.
