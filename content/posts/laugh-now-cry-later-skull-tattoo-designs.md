Patenting and registering an invention: What are the likely risks?
Patenting an invention is a process of officially registering a new product or service with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The benefits of patenting an invention include increased protection for your ideas, as well as easier access to potential customers and investors. However, there are a number of potential risks associated with patenting an invention. Here are three key points to consider when Patenting your Invention: 1) The USPTO can take years to review and grant a patent application, so it is important to be prepared for the wait. 2) There is a risk that your idea may not be accepted by the public or other decision-makers. 3) There is also a risk that your idea may not generate enough revenue to cover the costs associated with filing and prosecuting a patent application.
