The relationship between creativity and art: How does it work?
Creativity is often considered to be a two-way street. It can either be used to come up with ideas for new products or services, or it can be put into action to create beautiful artwork. art is not just about making things look pretty – it is also about stirring up emotions and conjuring up feelings in people. And that’s why the relationship between creativity and art is so important.
There are a few key factors that contribute to the creativity-art relationship. First, both artists and listeners need some form of stimulation in order to feel inspired. This could be anything from listening to music while brainstorming new ideas, or watching a movie while thinking out loud. Second, artists need some form of feedback in order to continue developing their skills and techniques. The more compliments an artist gets, the better they will become at their craft.
