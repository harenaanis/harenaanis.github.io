How can you improve your brainstroming skills?
If you're looking to boost your brainstroming skills, here are a few tips to get you started. First, keep track of how well you're doing on tasks that require thinking straight – such as solving problems or completing complex algebra problems. Additionally, practice focusing on one task at a time and try to force yourself to stay focused even when faced with difficult challenges. Finally, make sure that you have plenty of practice working with different types of materials (e.g., electronic computers, textiles, images), so that you can develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills you need for any field.

Invention results from a combination of creativity and hard work.
Invention can come from many sources, but often the most creative and efficient ways to achieve something are through collaboration. Inventorship is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that is not yet available to be created by others. Collaborative endeavors can result in novel solutions to problems and new products that are more advanced than what was possible before. These inventions are often the result of creativity and hard work combined, which has often lead to success for those who participate in these collaborative endeavors.

The Creative Process: How do we go about being creative?
Creativity is a process that we go through every day when we make something new. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new idea for a painting, or as complex as coming up with a new way to market a product. The key is to keep things fun, and to remember that creativity doesn't have to come from the outside- in fact, often the most creative people are the ones who are the most comfortable with their own ideas. So how do you go about becoming creative? Here are some tips: 
1) Take time for yourself- While it may seem like every day is another opportunity to come up with an idea, it's important to take breaks occasionally. If you're always working on projects or thinking about your work, you'll start to feel overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to negative feedback and decreased creativity.

How to get started: What should you do before starting any creative project?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any creative project. Before starting any creative project, it's important to have a grasp of what you want to create. There are many different ways to get started, but some things you should keep in mind before starting any creative project: 1) Know your target audience. What do you want your project to achieve? Are you looking to generate new ideas for clients or sell products? Knowing the target audience is key in getting started. 2) Be prepared for failure. Have you ever tried something and it didn't work out? Don't be afraid to give up. You can always try again later if the first attempt doesn't work. 3) Have a plan. A plan is key in making sure that your creative project goes smoothly and that you don't run into any problems along the way. 4) Be willing to grow and learn.
