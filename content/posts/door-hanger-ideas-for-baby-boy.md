Patent applications: What are the most common types of patent applications?
Patent applications are the single most common type of document filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). They account for about 60% of all patent filings, and they are also the most popular type of application.
There are many different types of patent applications, but three main types are: utility patents, design patents, and copyrights. Each has its own specific benefits and drawbacks, so it's important to understand which type is best for your product or idea.

 Utility patents are the most common type of patent application, and they're used to protect ideas that have no practical use yet but could be very beneficial in the future. For example, a company might file a utility patent for a new product that can help cut energy costs.

Design patents protect specific features or designs of products.

Creative ideas: How to come up with them?
Creative ideas are something that everyone has. Whether you’re a creative writer, artist, or just about anything else, creativity is always on the horizon. Here are 8 tips on how to come up with creative ideas:
1. Start with an idea and work from there. If you have an idea for a book, start by writing the first chapter and seeing what kind of feedback you get from readers. Once you have a feel for what works and doesn’t work in your book, then come up with some tweaks.

2. Get inspired by others. There are endless sources of inspiration when it comes to creative ideas! Look at paintings, sculptures, movies, TV shows – anything that inspires you in some way!

3. Take risks. When it comes to coming up with creative ideas, sometimes all it takes is a risk!
