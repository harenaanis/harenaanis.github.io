Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.

How to Choose the Right Home Improvement Project
Choosing the right home improvement project can be daunting, but with a little creativity and some helpful tips, it's easy to get started on your dreams. Here are a few tips to help you choose the right project:
1. Consider your budget: Even if you have an unlimited budget, it's important to take into account what you can spend and what you need. If you're limited in funds, consider using a lower-cost option rather than investing in an expensive home improvement project.

2. Work with a professional: When choosing a home improvement project, work with someone who has experience and knowledge of the industry. This will save time and money on the end result.

3. Take into account your space: Not every room needs new flooring or curtains; instead, focus on specific areas that need attention.
