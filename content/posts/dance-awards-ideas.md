The power of big Ideas
Big ideas are the lifeblood of businesses and organizations. They can help change the course of history, create new products or services, solve difficult problems or change the way we live.
Here are four ways big ideas can help your business:

This means trying out different models, scenarios and models of how these products or services could work in order to see if they're actually feasible and profitable.
