Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.

How to Use Innovation to Drive Results
Innovations can help businesses achieve success. Here are four ways to leverage innovation to drive results:
1. Use innovation to improve productivity and efficiency. When products are redesigned or new processes are created, employees can be more efficient in their work. This can lead to reduced costs and increased profits.
2. Use innovation to create new markets. When businesses adopt innovative products or services, they may find new customers who would not have otherwise been reached. This can lead to increased sales and a larger profit margin.
3. Use innovation to change the way people live and work. Innovative ideas can help businesses change the way people live for the better, including by increasing efficiency and productivity. This could lead to increased customer loyalty and a higher return on investment (ROI).
