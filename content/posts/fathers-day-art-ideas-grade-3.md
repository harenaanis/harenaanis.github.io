Definition of creativity: Pixar's Bob Crandall said "Creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected."
In an industry where creativity is often measured in terms of output, Pixar's Bob Crandall said that creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected. This definition has helped the animation studio create some of the most innovative and groundbreaking films in history, including Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Ratatouille.
While it may be a clichÃ© to say that creativity comes from the ability to think outside the box, Crandall's definition actually provides a more accurate definition for what makes creative individuals successful. By understanding how creativity works, businesses can better define their own goals and strategies for becoming more creative.

Conclusion
There are many different ways to come up with invention ideas. Some people keep a running list of things that annoy them, looking for patterns or problems that can be solved. Others look at existing products and try to come up with ways to improve them.
 Brainstorming with friends or family can also be a great way to generate new ideas. And sometimes, the best ideas come when you least expect itâ€”in the shower, while youâ€™re driving, or right before you fall asleep.

The important thing is to stay open to new ideas and be willing to experiment. You never know when that next great invention idea will strike!
