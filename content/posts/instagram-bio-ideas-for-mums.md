The three types of creativity: originality, imagination, and inventions
Creativity is a difficult quality to definition, as there are many different ways to define creativity. One example is imagining something or creating something new. Another example is originality, which refers to the invention or creation of something new. 
There are three main types of creativity: imaginative, creative, and invented. Imagination is the ability to see an idea or concept in your mind and create it out of nothing. Creative creativity comes from using your imagination and coming up with ideas that you haven’t thought of before. Inventions are creations that have never been done before and usually require a lot of hard work and dedication to make them a reality.

What can we do to prepare for 2020?
It has been announced that the United States will be leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2020. This decision is a result of the US president, Donald Trump, wanting to reduce trade deficits and increase economic growth. The main challenge for many countries planning for 2020 is how to prepare for this event. Here are some ideas to help: 
1. Make sure you have an idea of what your country’s trade deficit is. This information can be found on various websites or by talking to your business or government officials. 
2. Get involved in tariff debates with other countries. This can help you develop agreements that will protect your industry from new tariffs being placed by other countries. 
3. Do research on future trends in trade. By doing this, you will be able to identify any potential problems that may arise during the 2020 WTO membership negotiations.
