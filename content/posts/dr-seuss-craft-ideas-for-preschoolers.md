Examples of creative thinking in business
Creativity is a critical component of business. In fact, creativity is seen as one of the most important skills for businesses to possess. There are a number of ways businesses can use creativity in their operations and this column will explore an example from a logistics company.

Invention ideas are something that can be created easily and with little effort. To come up with them, you need to have a creative process in mind.
