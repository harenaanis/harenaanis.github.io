Commercialization of Inventions: How do you go about commercializing an invention?
Commercialization of inventions is a complicated and time-consuming process that often depends on the invention's potential market. There are a number of ways to commercialize an invention, but the process most likely to be successful is through licensing or technology transfer agreements. Licensing allows for a company to gain exclusive rights to use an invention, which can lead to large profits. Technology transfer agreements allow companies to share technology with other companies in order to create new products or services. These agreements can lead to large profits for the company involved as well as increased innovation and product competitiveness.

Get inspiration from others. People around you can be a great source of inspiration when it comes time to come up with new ideas.
