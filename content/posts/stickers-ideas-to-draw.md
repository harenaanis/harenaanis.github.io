Patenting: What is patenting?
Patenting inventions is a process of claiming property of a new invention, usually through issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) system, which provides a single source for public information on the state of patent application and issue ceremonies. This information can be used to assess whether an invention merits protection and to create precedents for future claims against others.
