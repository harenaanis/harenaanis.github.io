The role of technology in promoting innovation?
Technology has often been seen as a facilitator of innovation, with the ability to help organizations make faster and more efficient decisions. However, recent studies have shown that technology can also be used in an adversarial role, promoting innovation in the wrong direction. For example, Google was found to be using its search engine to promote its own products instead of those of other companies. In other cases, such as Apple's use of advertising to convince users to buy their products instead of competitors', technology can actually hinder innovation by creating a rift between different factions within an organization.

Conclusion: What are the benefits of developing big ideas?
Big ideas are the foundation of great businesses and civilizations. They're a way to think outside the box and come up with new solutions to old problems. With the right tools, big ideas can become realities. Here's how to develop big ideas for your business or organization:
1. Start by thinking about what you want your business or organization to achieve. What are your goals? What do you need to change in order to reach those goals? How will your customers feel if you don't deliver on those goals? What are some potential solutions to problems that you could address?

2. Next, think about who your target audience is. Who should be driving your business or organization forward? Do you want to reach a specific group of people, or do you want everyone who matters in your industry to be able to benefit from what you have to offer?

Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.
