Aesthetics: How people perceive art and how it affects them.
Creative art is all around us. Whether you're looking at a painting in a museum, or just taking a walk around your city, you'll see something beautiful. However, how people perceive creative art and how it affects them can differ greatly. For example, some people might see the beauty in the simplicity of a piece of art, while others might be turned off by formal or complex styles. The important thing is that everyone can enjoy creative art, regardless of their viewing preferences.

Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.
