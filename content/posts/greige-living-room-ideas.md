The main points of the article
1. Ideas can be put into many different categories, but the three most common are: problems, solutions, and potential solutions.
2. Solutions to problems are often the easiest to find, and often have obvious solutions. However, there may be multiple possible solutions that fit the problem and still meet the goals of the solution.

3. Potential solutions are more difficult to determine, but can provide a more complete or accurate solution than either a solution or a problem. They can also be less likely to cause further problems down the road.

Innovation is the key to success in any field. It allows businesses to adapt and change their products or services to meet the needs of their customers, and it drives economic growth.
This has been true for many industries, including technology, but it is especially important in the entertainment industry. With so many new technologies being developed every day, there's always room for Innovation to take hold and help companies achieve their goals.

One example of this is the video game industry. In recent years, there have been a number of new games released that are very innovative. One such game is "Destiny." This game is based on the Bible story of Adam and Eve and their attempt to escape from the Garden of Eden.
