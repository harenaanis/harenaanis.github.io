Evaluation methods
Evaluating ideas for inventions can be difficult. There are many factors to consider when trying to decide if an invention is worth pursuing. The first step is to come up with a list of criteria that the invention must meet. Once you have a list of criteria, you can start evaluating ideas against those criteria.
Some factors to consider when evaluating invention ideas include: market potential, patentability, manufacturing feasibility, and profitability. Other important considerations include: how unique the idea is, how much it will cost to develop and produce the invention, and whether there is a demand for the invention.
