The Importance of Being Creative: Why it's important to be creative when coming up with invention ideas.
Coming up with invention ideas requires a lot of creativity. After all, if you can't think of something new, you'll never be able to invent it.
But why is creativity so important when it comes to invention? For one, it allows you to come up with ideas that are truly original. And when you have an original idea, you're more likely to succeed because no one else has thought of it before.

Plus, being creative means that you're not afraid to take risks. And taking risks is essential when it comes to inventing something new. If you're not willing to take risks, you'll never achieve anything great.

So next time you're feeling stuck, remember that being creative is the key to coming up with invention ideas that are truly innovative and unique.

The Challenge of Innovation: How do we ensure that innovations are successful?
Innovation has always been a challenge. What makes it so difficult is that it often hinges on the right decisions and the right team. Today, with advancements in technology, innovation is even more important. Here are three challenges that need to be overcome if innovation is to succeed:
1. The Myth of the One True Idea
 knapsackers faced a similar challenge when they sought ways to improve their productivity. “There was only one way to do it, and that was by following the recipe,” says Allen Weinberg, MIT mathematician and co-author of The Art of Computer Programming. Even today, some companies continue this paradigm by insisting on using only one approach for every product or service. This limits creativity and variety in the marketplace, which can lead to success or failure in innovation.
