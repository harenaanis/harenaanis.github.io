Creative ways to use creativity in your day-to-day life
Creativity is a key part of life and can be used to come up with new ideas, solve problems, and achieve goals. Here are some creative ways to use creativity in your day-to-day life:
1. Get inspired by nature: Look at pictures of natural disasters or scenes from around the world and think of creative ways you could incorporate them into your home or workspace. This can be a great way to bond with nature and get lost in the moment.
2. Try something new: When you have a blank canvas, try painting or sculpting without any preconceptions about what you will end up with. Just go for it! This can help you start thinking outside the box and come up with new ideas that might not have been considered before.
3. Get organized: When it comes to creativity, order is key.

What will be the impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning on society?
As the world moves closer to artificial intelligence and machine learning becoming more commonplace, society will face various changes. One of the most significant changes will be how work and life is organized. currently, many people are employed through their companies or by working off of a job contract. With the rise of AI and machine learning, this system could change completely. Instead of having someone employed by their company for a certain amount of time, people may instead be hired as “artificial intelligence assistants” or “machine learning experts”. This would change the way we interact with our machines, as well as how work is done. Additionally, businesses will have to adjust their business models in order to keep up with this new technology.
