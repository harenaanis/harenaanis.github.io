The Basics: How do you choose the right tools and materials for a DIY project?
When starting a DIY project, the first step is to decide what you want to do. This can be broken down into five categories: tools, materials, method, tools and techniques, and time. Now that you have an idea of what you need and want, it's time to choose the right tools and materials for your project.
Tools
Choose the right tool for the job. There are many different types of tools available which can be used for a variety of tasks.

Different types of innovation: What are some common examples?
Innovation is a term that has been used for centuries to describe different types of change. Different types of innovation can be described in two ways: product and process innovation. Product innovation refers to the development of a new product, while process innovation refers to the improvement of a process, such as adding new technology or modifying an existing one. 
Product innovation usually occurs when two companies come up with a new product that is better than what was before. Process innovation, on the other hand, often happens when companies try to improve an existing process so it can be more efficient and accurate. This can involve adding new technology or changing how an old process is run.
