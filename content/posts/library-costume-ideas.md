Business: What is the significance of invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new or change in a product or service. Inventions can be either small or large, and they can come from anyone in the business world. Some of the most famous inventions include the Telephone, the Computer, and the Television. There are many different reasons why an invention might be important, and each invention has its own importance.
