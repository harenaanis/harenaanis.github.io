Tools: How should you use the tools you have?
If you have a few tools that you like to use, it's important to know how to use them in order to get the most out of them. Here are four easy ways to use your tools the right way:
1) Make a toolset: When you have a few tools, it's better to make a toolset rather than purchase individual tools. This will save you time and money in the long run. A good starting point is an electronic toolkit, such as this one from Amazon. You can find other options here.

2) Use common sense: It's important not only to be able to use your tools but also be aware of what they do. If something doesn't work or doesn't seem right, try turning it around and using another tool instead.

Different Types of Creativity: Why does one type work better than another?
Creativity is a complex and subjective thing. There are many factors that influence it. One of the most important ones is creativity's ability to imagine new things. One type of creativity, called brainstorming, is often used in creative workflows. It allows people to generate new ideas and concepts rapidly. But there are other types of creativity as well, so why does one work better than another?
Some research has shown that creativity is linked with problem solving. When people come up with ideas for products or services, they tend to be innovative and solve problems quickly. This type of creativity is often effective when it comes to creating new products or services. However, another study found that brainstorming was not as effective as problem solving when it came to creating new solutions for common problems.
