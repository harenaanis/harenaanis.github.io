Invention Ideas: How to Be More Creative and Inventive
When it comes to being creative, there are a few things you can do to help yourself become more inventive. First, take some time to brainstorm. Get a piece of paper and a pen, and start jotting down whatever comes to mind. Don't censor yourself; just let the ideas flow. Once you have a good list of ideas, start looking for patterns and connections between them. What do they have in common? What are their differences?

Another helpful tip is to try something new. Be open to exploring different activities, hobbies, and interests. This will help broaden your perspective and give you more fodder for your brainstorming sessions. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment. The best way to come up with new ideas is to play around with the ones you already have.

The challenges of big ideas: What can prevent them from becoming successful?
When it comes to big ideas, sometimes the obstacles are simply too great. When it comes to innovation, often times what's required is a willingness to take on new challenges and risk everything for the sake of something better. But in some cases, taking such risks can actually backfire, leading to less innovation and more stagnation. Here are six examples of how big ideas can fail:
1) Failing to appreciate the uniqueness of each idea

One of the biggest challenges faced by big ideas is that they often come from unique perspectives or points of view. This can be difficult to take on and even harder to understand, let alone replicate. In order for an idea to succeed, it needs to be seen as unique and valuable in its own right – not just by those who came up with it but also by those who will use it in the future.
