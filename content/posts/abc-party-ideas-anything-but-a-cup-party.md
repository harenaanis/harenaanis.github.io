Is it something that could actually happen or is it something you think will only take a while to come up with? Lastly, do you have a clear vision for what the idea should be?

Invention: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention has been a key feature of human history. From the development of tools and weapons to the invention of new transportation methods, innovation has always been a part of human culture. However, over time, innovation has become more complex and dynamic. Innovation can be described as the process by which new ideas, technologies, or business models are created. It encompasses everything from developing new products to creating new ways of doing business.
One example of this evolution is the development of technology. Technology has constantly changed over time and has helped increase efficiency in many industries. For example, airplane travel was originally difficult and expensive to achieve, but with the development of airplanes, people could now travel all over the world easily. The same can be said for computer programs and other technological developments. By changing how we use these technologies, we have increased their efficiencies and made them more available to everyone.
