Ideas for Bigger Ideas: What are some ideas for bigger ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are plenty of them out there. And while all of them have potential to make a real impact, some may be more achievable than others. Here are some ideas for bigger ideas:
1. Make the world a better place through innovation. This is something that has been talked about for years and it's still not happening as fast as people need it to. Innovation can come from anything – from improving education to developing new ways of manufacturing products.

2. Create more jobs in the United States. The country is struggling right now and there are too many people without good jobs. There are ways that we can create more jobs and improve the economy so that everyone can benefit. Some examples include creating new businesses or increasing the number of job opportunities at existing businesses.

3. Save the environment.

The power of collaboration:
When it comes to creative ideas, two heads are better than one. That’s the power of collaboration.
Working with someone else can help you come up with ideas you never would have thought of on your own. And it can also make the process more fun. But how do you find the right collaborator?

First, look for someone who has complementary skills to yours. If you’re a big-picture thinker, team up with someone who’s good at details. If you’re more of a doer, find someone who’s good at generating ideas.

Second, make sure you have similar goals and values. You want to be on the same page from the start so there are no surprises down the road.

Finally, trust your gut. Go with your instinct when it comes to choosing a collaborator.
