Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.

The power of suggestion: How can creativity be used to create ideas?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability. But it can also be used to create new ideas. In fact, suggestion can be one of the most powerful tools that you have. By suggesting an idea to someone, you can increase the chance of them actually following through with it. Here are three ways that suggestion can help you get your creative juices flowing: 
1. Suggest a task that someone may not have considered before: Often times, when we think about creativity, we think about things that are immediately obvious or something that we ourselves could do. However, many times what we see in front of us is simply too daunting or complex for us to tackle on our own.suggesting a task that someone may not have considered before can help open up their minds and allow them to become inspired by something new and unfamiliar.

How to Use Nice Ideas to Make a Great Product
Nice ideas are a great way to make a great product. By using nice ideas, you can increase the chances of success for your project. Here are five tips to help you use nice ideas to create a successful product:
1. Start with common problems and solutions. When you start with a problem or solution, you’re more likely to find common ground and develop an idea that everybody can understand.

2. Be specific. If you don’t have a good idea, it’s much harder to come up with something that people will want and use. Be sure to include enough detail so that potential customers can understand what they’re buying and why they should invest in it.

3. Be willing to pivot.
