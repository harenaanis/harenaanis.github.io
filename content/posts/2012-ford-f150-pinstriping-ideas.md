What are some common creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to reinventing the wheel. Here are five creative ideas that come to mind when thinking about creative ideas: 
1. Use discarded materials to create something new. For example, if you have a bunch of old cereal boxes lying around, go through them and discard any that are too large or bulky to use. Once you’ve eliminated the big ones, start stacking these in different positions to see what kind of shapes and designs emerge.
2. Try a new approach to an existing idea. If you’ve been using the same recipe for years, try using a different type of flour or sugar in your baking recipes. This will give your baking recipes a bit of a fresh start and make them more delicious overall.
3. Take advantage of unused space.
