brainstorming: How do you start brainstorming?
brainstorming is a process by which creative ideas are generated. It can be used to come up with solutions to problems, new concepts or just thinking out loud. There are different ways you can start brainstorming and it really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for ideas for your next project then the best way to start is by talking to friends, family or others who have had the same experience. If you are looking for ideas for personal projects then there are many different ways to generate them. One way is by using online tools like Google Docs or Excel. Another way is by taking a walk around your neighbourhood and seeing what people are doing that might be inspiration for your own project. The bottom line is that regardless of what method you choose, always ensure that you are working in a productive manner and that you are making sure that your ideas get put into action.

The challenges of big ideas: What can prevent them from becoming successful?
When it comes to big ideas, sometimes the obstacles are simply too great. When it comes to innovation, often times what's required is a willingness to take on new challenges and risk everything for the sake of something better. But in some cases, taking such risks can actually backfire, leading to less innovation and more stagnation. Here are six examples of how big ideas can fail:
1) Failing to appreciate the uniqueness of each idea

One of the biggest challenges faced by big ideas is that they often come from unique perspectives or points of view. This can be difficult to take on and even harder to understand, let alone replicate. In order for an idea to succeed, it needs to be seen as unique and valuable in its own right – not just by those who came up with it but also by those who will use it in the future.
