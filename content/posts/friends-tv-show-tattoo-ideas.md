It allows businesses to create new products, services and processes that improve customer experience,cut costs, or create new markets. Innovation also drives down prices for goods and services, making them more affordable for consumers.

However, times have changed and now innovation can come from anything - technology, creativity or business acumen. Here are three Case Studies that illustrate why innovation is so important today:
