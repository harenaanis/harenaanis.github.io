Immigration and Customs Enforcement: What changes will need to be made to deal with this growing problem?
The number of people apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has increased by 50 percent in just five years, according to a report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The report also found that CBP is struggling with the increasing number of asylum seekers and refugees, as well as its own staffing shortages.
One solution to the problem may be to consider changes to how the agency handles immigration. One idea would be to relax requirements for criminal background checks on those seeking entry into the country, which can lead to more individuals being admitted without proper vetting. Another idea would be to increase funding for CBP so that it can properly patrol the country's borders and handle operations like search and seizure in more efficient ways.

Conclusion
After months of toiling away on a project, it can be easy to feel like you've lost your creative edge. Fear not! Here are a few tips to help get your creative juices flowing again.
1. Take a break: Sometimes the best way to get out of a rut is to take a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. This will help you come back to your project with fresh eyes and new ideas.
2. Talk to others: When you're feeling stuck, talking to other creatives can give you some great ideas. Ask them how they overcame their own creative blocks, what resources they use and what techniques work best for them.
3. Doodle: Sometimes the quickest way to jump start your creativity is simply to start doodling.
