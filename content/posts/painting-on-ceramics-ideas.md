1. Start with a strong hook. This could be a powerful quote, an interesting stat, or even a shocking story. Whatever you choose, make sure it's something that will pique your reader's interest and leave them wanting more.

2. Write in a clear and concise manner. No one wants to wade through a bunch of fluff in order to get to the good stuff. Get straight to the point and make every word count.
