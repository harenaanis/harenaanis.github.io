The educational process of creativity: How does it happen?
Creativity, or the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts, is an important part of any successful artist. However, the process of creativity can vary depending on how someone is educated. Some people learn how to be creative through art classes or Leroy Sizemore’s The Creative Process. Others learn it through reading or watching creative minds work. Regardless of how someone learns to be creative, the end goal is the same-to come up with new ideas and concepts that can help them in their artwork and business endeavors.

What are some common problems that come with big ideas?
There are a number of common problems that come with big ideas, including: 1) not knowing how to conceptualize and execute them; 2) not knowing what to do with positive feedback when it's available; and 3) not being able to focus on the bigger picture. If you're struggling with any of these issues, here are some tips to help you overcome them: 
1) Draw on your own personal experience or experiences from others in order to understand what works for them. This will help you gain a better understanding of how your idea can be executed. 
2) Take a step back and analyze your idea in terms of its overall goal rather than just individual goals. This will help you figure out whether or not it's worth pursuing. 
3) Don't be afraid to ask for help when it comes time to execute your idea.
