What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new products, services, or ideas that are different from the ones that have been before. It can be called creative change, and it can happen in a number of ways: through product development (racting evidence to create a new product), market research (finding out what people want and need), or process improvement (making things easier or faster). Innovation is often about finding solutions to problems that people have never considered before.

The challenges of coming up with big ideas
In any creative endeavor, there are always challenges to overcome. Whether it’s coming up with original ideas or finding your voice in a crowd of others, creativity is always a work in progress. And while some challenges can be easily resolved (such as coming up with a great slogan), others pose more difficult obstacles. Big Ideas are one such challenge, and while they can be easy to come by (just look at any popular blog or online article on the topic), they often require time and effort to put together into a successful product or business idea.
Despite the challenge, big ideas make for great products and businesses. They represent an innovative new way of thinking that can encourage change and spur innovation. And while big ideas can take time and effort to develop into something successful, they’re worth the investment.
