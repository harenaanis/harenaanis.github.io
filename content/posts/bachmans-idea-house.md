What are some common ways to get started with ideas?
Ideas can come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common: they're always ready to be used. Whether you're looking to start a new project, brainstorm for a new business idea, or just get your creative juices flowing, ideas are a essential part of any creative process. Here are five ways to get started with ideas: 
1. Take some time to think about what you want your business to be. This can be done by brainstorming different concepts or by taking a look at what others have done and figuring out how you could improve on it. 
2. Get organized. Once you've decided on the idea, it's time to start thinking about what kind of organization would work best for it. This can involve creating an outline or organizing everything by genre or need. 
3. Take some notes.
