Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.

Customer Loyalty: What is customer loyalty and how can it be increased in your business?
Customer loyalty is one of the most important aspects of a business. It is the basis for why people are customers and how they can be continued to be customers. Loyalty is increased when businesses provide value, implement change, and are responsive to customer needs. Here are three new ideas for increasing customer loyalty in your business:
1. Offer more value to customers: When you offer more value to customers, they will become more loyal. This can be done by adding features or services that are not currently available or by reducing prices. By doing this, you will create an emotional connection with your customers and increase their loyalty.

2. Change with the times: When you keep up with the latest trends in your industry, you will increase your chances of being a successful business.
