What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

End result of creativity: What happens to creativity when it's used?
Creativity flourishes when it's used for good, but often its fruits are sour. In the worst case, creativity can lead to disaster, as in the case of some artists who misuse their creativity. Creative art can be beautiful and inspiring, but also can lead to catastrophe if not used for its intended purpose - creating something new and valuable.
