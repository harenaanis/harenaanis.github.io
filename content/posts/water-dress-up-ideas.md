The power of creativity
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. It is the ability to see things differently, to make connections that others don’t see, and to come up with new ideas and solutions.
Creativity is what allows us to solve problems, to invent new technologies, and to create works of art that move and inspire us. It is the engine of progress. And it is something that we all have within us.

So why is creativity so powerful? One reason is that it helps us to see the world in new ways. When we are faced with a problem, creative thinking allows us to find new solutions that we might not have otherwise considered.

Another reason is that creativity allows us to tap into our imagination and come up with ideas that are truly original.

Introduce the topic of invention.
Invention is the process or art of creating something new, whether it is a physical object, a piece of software, or a process. It is an important part of human history and has played a significant role in our development as a species.
Invention is not just about coming up with something new; it is also about improving upon existing ideas and technologies. This can be seen in the way that many inventions are built upon the work of previous inventors. For example, the Wright brothers were able to build upon the work of earlier aviation pioneers to create the first successful airplane.

Invention is also about solving problems. Inventors are often motivated by a desire to solve a particular problem that they have encountered in their own lives. This was the case with Benjamin Franklin, who invented the lightning rod after being struck by lightning himself.
