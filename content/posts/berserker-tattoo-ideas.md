How creativity is used in the creative process: creative drawings, paintings, poems, etc.
Creativity is a key component of the creative process. By using different creative methods, artists are able to come up with new ideas and solutions that can help them achieve their goals. For example, when creating a painting, a creative artist might use different colors to create a realistic scene. Similarly, when writing poetry, the writer may use alliteration or other forms of poetry to make the words seem more interesting. In both cases, the artist and writer are trying to find ways to express themselves through their art.

Tips For Creating More Effective Art: What tips can you give to help improve your artwork?
When it comes to creating effective art, there are a few things you can do to help. Here are some tips that may help improve your work: 
1. Start with a good idea. When you have an idea for an artwork, the next step is to develop it into a complete work. This means working on the ideas and concepts behind your piece before starting on the actual painting or sculpture. 

2. Take advantage of constructive criticism. A lot of times it’s helpful to get feedback from other people in order to improve your pieces. It will also give you a better understanding of what worked and what didn’t work in your work overall. 

3. Be persistent. The best way to stay motivated when painting or sculpture is to keep pushing yourself.
