Invention as an act or process: What are some examples?
There are many examples of Invention as an act or process. Sometimes people invent things just because they think they can and sometimes people invent things to help others. Inventors often have a vision for what they want their invention to be, and they work towards making that vision a reality. Some examples of Invention include: 
1) Wiring diagrams: Many inventions are born of need, like the Telephone. Mechanical engineers had been working on creating electrical wiring diagrams for centuries before Alexander Graham Bell came up with the idea for theTelephone.
2) The computer: Inventions like the transistor and laser were all born from necessity - computers did not exist until after WWII because scientists could not build them on a large scale.
3) The airplane: Wright brothers flew airplanes in 1903 without any assistance from anyone else!

Definition of invention: What is it and what does it mean for society?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something existing. It can be anything from a new product to a new idea for a business. Inventions have a big impact on society because they can change the way we live and work. They can also create new opportunities for businesses and people.
One of the key definitions for invention is "a means of producing something which had not been produced before, or that is different from what has been produced previously." This definition encompasses everything from products to ideas to methods of transportation. Inventors are often incredibly creative and come up with amazing ideas that could change the world. Without invention, there would likely be very few innovations in our lives.

Invention has played an important role in human history since prehistoric times. For example, early humans used tools to make their way through life and get food and shelter.
