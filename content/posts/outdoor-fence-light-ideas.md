Group brainstorming: the benefits of working together
When it comes to brainstorming, there are certain benefits that come from working with a group. For one, more ideas are generated when people work together. In addition, groups can help to build on each other’s ideas, leading to even better solutions.
Another benefit of group brainstorming is that it can help to create a sense of camaraderie and collaboration within a team. Working together towards a common goal can help to build relationships and trust between team members.

Finally, brainstorming in a group can also lead to more creative thinking. When people are working together, they often think outside the box and come up with solutions that they may not have thought of on their own. This type of creativity is essential in today’s business world.
