Why do people want to get ideas?
Ideas are alive, they always have been and always will be. They bring light to dark places and inspire people to do great things. However, the key to getting ideas is understanding what you want to achieve with them and coming up with a plan. 
People often want to get ideas because they don't know what they're looking for or where to start. When you have an idea, it can help you see your potential projects in a whole new light and give you a better idea of what you should be working on next. It's also helpful if you have some inspiration from someone else who has had success with their project or if you simply want some new perspective on something. If all of this doesn't sound like it would work for you, there are plenty of online tools that can help get started.
