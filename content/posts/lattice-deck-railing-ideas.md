Types of Innovation:
It can be difficult to know what innovation is. For some, it’s a new technology or business model that is different from the ones currently in use. Others might call it when a company applies creativity and innovation to solve a problem or make a better product. Innovation can occur in any area of business, but some are more prevalent than others. Here are six types of innovation:
1. Procedural Innovation – This involves taking existing processes and making them more efficient or simple so they can be used by other businesses or organizations. This can include developing new methods for manufacturing products or improving how data is collected and organized.

2. Creative Innovation – This refers to using creativity and imagination to come up with novel solutions to problems or make better products. It often includes coming up with ideas that others wouldn’t think of and working tirelessly to bring them to fruition.

Summary: What are the benefits of having more ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any creative business. They can change how you think and how you operate, giving your business the power to succeed. But what are the benefits of having more ideas? Here are five key ones:
1. You can be more productive. When you have more ideas, you're less likely to get bogged down in a same-old routine and therefore have more time to complete projects.
2. You can be more innovative. By having more ideas, you're less likely to follow someone else's plan and get stuck with something that's not working.
3. You can be better organized. Having lots of ideas means being able to see things from a different perspective and then coming up with a plan for dealing with those perspectives in order to make things work well together.
4. You can be cheaper and faster than ever before.

Why creativity is important: What does it mean for business and life?
Creativity is important for business and life. It can mean new ideas, coming up with new ways to do things, or simply a different perspective on an old problem. In most cases, creativity is essential for businesses and people to continue their momentum and grow in their careers. However, it can also be dangerous to rely exclusively on creativity alone to solve problems, as it can quickly become exhausted and stale. There are a few factors that help to keep creativity fresh and ongoing, and these are key to success in any field: having a diverse range of ideas, keeping our imaginations active by letting them roam free, developing our creative abilities over time, being comfortable with risk and uncertainty, and always looking for ways to improve upon what we’ve done before.
