Circuit design: What are some tips for circuit design?
Circuit design is key to creating efficient, reliable and accurate circuits. By understanding the basics of circuit design, you can create circuits that are both durable and efficient. Some tips for circuit design include:
1. Choose an appropriate frequency range for your applications. When designing circuits, it is important to choose an appropriate frequency range for your specific application. For example, if you need a noise-cancelling phone speaker, then you should select a frequency range that does not cause sound distortion.

2. Use components that are compatible with each other. When building circuits, it is important to use compatible component parts. This will help ensure that the circuits are stable and accurate. For example, when using transistors in a circuit, it is important to use component parts that are compatible with each other so that the transistor can work correctly and no interference arises.
