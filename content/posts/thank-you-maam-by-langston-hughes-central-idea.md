One idea is to create a city-wide transportation system that would include a variety of forms of public transportation, such as bike share, tram, and bus.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from improving a simple process to creating something entirely new. Whether you're looking to improve your work or create something completely new, there are plenty of creative ideas out there that can help you achieve your goals. Here are a few of our favorite creative ideas: 
1. Use data to improve your work: By using data to improve how we produce and consume our products, we can make them more efficient and effective. This could involve redesigning the product, figuring out how best to market it, or even finding new ways to landfill the old ones. 
2. Experiment with different design solutions: Experimenting with different design solutions can help you find the most successful way to produce a product or reach your target audience.

Conclusion: What does it all mean?
Creative work has been around for centuries, and it is no secret that many people see it as a means to an end. In some cases, the end may be financial compensation or even fame, but in most cases the end is a product of creativity. Whether itâ€™s making something new or taking something old and turning it into something new, creativity is always a key ingredient.
