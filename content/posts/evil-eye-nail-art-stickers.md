Invention Ideas: How to Be More Creative and Inventive
When it comes to being creative, there are a few things you can do to help yourself become more inventive. First, take some time to brainstorm.

Once you have a good list of ideas, start looking for patterns and connections between them. What do they have in common? What are their differences?

Another helpful tip is to try something new. Be open to exploring different activities, hobbies, and interests. This will help broaden your perspective and give you more fodder for your brainstorming sessions. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment.
