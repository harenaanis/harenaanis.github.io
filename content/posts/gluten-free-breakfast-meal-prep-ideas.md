What are some ideas?
Ideas can be anything that works for you. Whether it's a new hobby, new way of looking at things, or a new way to approach an old problem, there are endless possibilities out there. But what are some ideas? Here are eight ideas to get you started: 
1. Take a break: Sometimes the best way to clear your head and start fresh is to take a break. Get up and walk around, do something physical, or read something inspiring. 
2. New perspective: If you're stuck on an issue, trying a different perspective can help solve it. Think about how other people have approached the problem before you and see if there's a different way to look at it.

How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.
