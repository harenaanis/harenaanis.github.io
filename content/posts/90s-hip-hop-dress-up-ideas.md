Creative process: How does a creative artist go about creating work?
Creativity is an essential part of any creative artist’s process. The way a creative artist goes about creating work varies depending on the artist and their unique strengths and weaknesses. However, some basic steps that any creativeartist must take in order to create excellent work are as follows:
1. Determine what you want your work to be. This includes answering the question, “What does this piece of art represent for me?” After answering this question, you can begin to develop ideas for what your piece may look like or how it could be done.

2. Come up with a title and concept for your work. Once you have a title and concept, it is time to start developing the plot or story behind your work. This will involve coming up with characters and setting the scene for your story.

3. Start writing!
