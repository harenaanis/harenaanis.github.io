To improve overall health, we need to understand the root causes of these problems and take the necessary steps to fix them. Here are five key ideas to help you do just that:

Definition of art: The process of creating a piece of art
As somebody who spends a great deal of time creating art, it's important to have a clear definition for what art is. Whether you're talking about creative writing, painting, or sculpture, there are some commonalities that all art possess. So without further ado, here's the definition for art:
