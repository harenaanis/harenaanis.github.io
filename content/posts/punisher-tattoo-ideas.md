Creative minds have a lot in common
Creative minds share obsessive and often unsustainable goals, a need to explore and tap into new ideas, and a penchant for risk-taking. They are also known for their creativity and innovation, sometimes at the expense of common sense. But despite these similarities, there are some key differences between creative minds that can help explain why they can be so successful.

Invention history: How did some of the earliest inventions get started?
Inventions have a long and complicated history, with some getting started much earlier than others. Here are some of the most notable inventions, starting with the oldest:
The first true computer was built in the late 17th century by Johannes Gutenberg, who used a printing press to create movable type. The printing press had potential to spread literacy and knowledge far beyond the small town where Gutenberg resided.

Invention ideas are often hatched out of boredom or frustration. In 1823, Charles Babbage designed a machine that could solve problems in mathematics that had never been solved before. The machine was code-named Analytical Engine and it was not completed until 1831.

But even the earliest machines didn’t always get results they were hoping for.
