Invention is the act of making something new, or the process of coming up with new ideas. It is often considered to be a creative act, one that involves coming up with something that has never been thought of before. Inventions can be small, like a new way to open a jar, or big, like a new type of engine. They can be simple, like a new way to tie a shoe, or complex, like a new computer system.
