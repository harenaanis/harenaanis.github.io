The benefits of big ideas: What are they, and why should we care?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of innovation. They can change the world, and sometimes all it takes is a great idea to get started. Here are three reasons why big ideas should be of utmost importance to businesses and individual citizens alike: 
1) Big ideas can inspire new thinking and creativity. When a business or individual sees something that they believe could have a profound impact, they often come up with new business models or theories to pursue those ideas. 

2) Big ideas can build communities of support. No one invention or discovery is ever complete; rather, every step in the development of big ideas brings us closer to becoming one cohesive unit. This sense of community also makes it easier for individuals to raise money and create products/services that have a real impact on society as a whole. 

3) Big ideas may help solve pressing global problems.

The Benefits of Having Ideas: What are the benefits ofhaving ideas?
Ideas are a powerful way to think about and solve problems. They can help you come up with new ideas for products, services, or projects. However, having ideas doesn't have to be easy. There are many benefits to having great ideas. Here are some of the most common:
1) You can improve your creativity. When you have fresh, innovative thoughts in mind, you can come up with more creative solutions than if you had been thinking about the same thing pre-viously.

2) You can take your innovation further. If you have great ideas but no idea how to execute them, learning from others will help you develop your own business idea and go beyond what others have done before.

3) You can save time and money.
