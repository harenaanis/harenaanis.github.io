2020: How do we make sure that our 2020 election is fair?
In 2020, the United States will face another harsh election season. Key issues that will be debated include how to make sure that the election is fair and what measures can be taken to prevent fraud. Here are four ideas for making sure that the 2020 election is fair: 
1. Create a public database of all registered electors in order to help ensure accuracy and transparency. This would help reduce voter fraud and make it easier for voters to check whether their ballot has been cast correctly. 
2. Increase the number of voting machines from precincts to whole neighborhoods so that more people can vote in one voting place rather than scattered throughout various precincts. This would improve security and ensure that all ballots are counted accurately. 
3. Make it easier for citizens with disabilities to vote by offering identification requirements or waiving residency requirements in certain cases.

Conclusion: Creative Thinking Tips for You
Creative thinking can help you come up with unique and innovative ideas. Here are a few tips to get started:
1. Keep your ideas open-ended – don’t have everything mapped out in your head before you start brainstorming. Be flexible and allow yourself to change and evolve your ideas as you think of more.

2. If you want to be really successful at creative thinking, keep things simple and achievable. Try not to overthink things or try to come up with too many solutions at once – just focus on the problem at hand and see where it leads.

3. Don’t be afraid to experiment – there is no limit to what you can achieve when you take risks and try new methods.

Invention: The history of invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, whether it is a new product, service or technology. It has been around for centuries and has had a wide variety of outcomes. 
One of the earliest examples of invention was in 100 BC when two brothers, Eudoxus and Philoctetes, came up with the idea of writing. They were the first to patent their invention and it soon became a household word. 

Inventions have also been used for military purposes. The world’s first anti-tank grenade was created by Raphael Salomon in 1795 and it was used in World War 1 to help destroy German tanks. 

Today, innovation continues to play an important role in our lives. There are many different ways that innovation can be used to create new products, services and technologies.
