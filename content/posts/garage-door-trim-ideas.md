1. Always have a notebook with you when you are brainstorming. This will help you keep track of all the different ideas that come up. 
2. Use different language whenbrainstorming. French is often used for brainstorms because it is easy to remember sounding terms and words. Other languages may also be used depending on the topic at hand.
