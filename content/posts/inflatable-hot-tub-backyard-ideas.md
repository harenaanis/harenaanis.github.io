Conclusion: Why should we care about invention?
Invention is the creative process of coming up with a new idea or design. It can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. The invention of the printing press was an incredible event in human history, and it is also responsible for many medical advances. There are countless other examples that can be provided, but the point is that invention is important.
There are several reasons why innovation should be taken seriously. First, innovation allows companies and countries to come up with new products and technologies faster than they would otherwise be able to. Second, it helps businesses make money by creating new ideas and products that people will want to buy. Third, innovation can help scientists learn more about how the world works and how to better understand problems. Finally, innovation can help society function more efficiently – for example, by developing new ways of warfare or managing social networks.

Review: What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new recipe to designing a new piece of clothing. However, some creative ideas are better than others. Here are five creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with the basics: Start by brainstorming what your idea could be. What are some things you can think of that could be used in your idea? Examples might include an ornament, a piece of art, or even a little project for your room. 
2. Think outside the box: Once you have an idea for something, start thinking about ways to make it work. What is something that has never been done before? How can you make it unique and interesting? 
3. Be daring: Don’t just take what someone has already done and create something new; go beyond what people usually think of when they think of creativity.
