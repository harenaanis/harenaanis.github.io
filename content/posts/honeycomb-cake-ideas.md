How will new technologies affect our lives?
New technologies are constantly changing and advancing, making it difficult to predict how they will affect our lives. Some potential changes include: 
1) Increased use of AI – This technology is already changing the way we live, with companies like Amazon looking to use AI in everything from customer service to parcel delivery. 
2) Low-cost 4G phones – It’s not hard to imagine a future where everyone has a low-cost 4G phone that they can use anywhere. This could have a significant impact on how we live and work, as well as what kind of services we can access. 
3)Augmented Reality (AR): In 2020, AR will become more prevalent than ever before, with devices like Google Daydream View and Apple’s A12 Bionic Chipset capable of rendering 3D content in real time.

Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.
