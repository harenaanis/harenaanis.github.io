The different approaches to creativity: art, design, science, and technology.
Creativity is a word that is often used interchangeably with art, design, science and technology. Each of these fields has its own approach to creativity, which can be seen in different ways. For example, art typically involves creating something new and original. Design is the process of coming up with a plan or specification for an object or project. Science is the study of the natural world and how it behaves. This can include studying how things work and how we can use that knowledge to create objects or projects. All of these approaches to creativity can have different benefits, which are important to consider when designing or creating objects or projects.
