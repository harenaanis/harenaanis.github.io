How do we become involved in the invention process?
Invention is a process where people come up with new ideas for products or services. It can be difficult to come up with new ideas, but there are many ways to get involved in the process. There are several ways to become involved in the invention process, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
One way to become involved in the invention process is to attend an inventor's mixer. An inventor's mixer allows people to share their ideas with other inventors and potential customers. It can also help people develop their ideas more effectively.

Another way to become involved in the invention process is by working on a project with another person. When you are working with someone else, you have a better chance of developing your idea together and making it a reality. This is important because it can help you learn about other people's concepts and how they would approach solving a problem.

When it comes to being creative, there are a lot of things that can hold us back. Whether it's fear, self-doubt, or just not knowing where to start, these blocks can keep us from coming up with great ideas.
