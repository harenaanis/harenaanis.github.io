Big ideas are what inspire change. They're the seeds that can grow into something new, something better. Sometimes all it takes is a good idea to sparking off an idea that turns into a movement. That's what happened with the women's rights movement. There was no one big idea behind it, but many smaller ones that helped lead to larger changes.

Repainting a Room: Tips and tricks for painting a room successfully.
If you’re looking to spruce up your living room or bedroom, there are a few easy tricks to help out. Here are a few tips to repaint your room successfully:
1) Start with the basics: Paint the walls first and then the ceiling. This will give your painting project a more unified feel.

2) Use a light color for each area of the room: If you want your walls to be in one color, use that color in all of your walls. If you want your ceilings and floors to be different colors, start with one color and add other shades as needed.

3) Don’t forget about trim: Wipe down any debris that may have built up on the wallpapers or flooring, and try to get rid of any excess paint.

Invention definition: A creative act or process of coming up with a new idea or product.
Inventions are the backbone of business. They allow companies to make new products and services, without having to go through the trouble of developing them from scratch. And they do this by simply coming up with a new idea, or creating a better design than what was previously available.
However, there are different types of inventions. Some are more creative than others. Here, we will take a look at five different types of inventions:

1) Science fiction: Science fiction is a genre of speculative fiction that deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. It has been called the "literature of ideas", and often explores the potential consequences of scientific, social, and technological innovations.

2) Pharmaceuticals: Pharmaceuticals are products used to treat diseases or improve their symptoms.
