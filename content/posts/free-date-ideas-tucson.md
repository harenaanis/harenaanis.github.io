Innovation is essential for businesses to survive and thrive in today’s ever-changing landscape. However, many organizations struggle with innovation because of various barriers.

To overcome this, organizations need to create an environment where it’s okay to fail. This can be done by Encouraging employees to experiment and think outside the box, Celebrating small successes, and Learning from failures.
