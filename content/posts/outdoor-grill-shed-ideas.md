Evaluation methods
Evaluating ideas for inventions can be difficult. There are many factors to consider when trying to decide if an invention is worth pursuing. The first step is to come up with a list of criteria that the invention must meet. Once you have a list of criteria, you can start evaluating ideas against those criteria.
Some factors to consider when evaluating invention ideas include: market potential, patentability, manufacturing feasibility, and profitability. Other important considerations include: how unique the idea is, how much it will cost to develop and produce the invention, and whether there is a demand for the invention.

The best way to evaluate an invention idea is to consult with experts in the field. These experts can help you determine if an idea has potential and is worth pursuing. They can also provide guidance on how to develop and commercialize the invention.

The Future of Housing: How will technology change housing and homelessness?
Technology is already changing many aspects of our everyday lives, from how we shop to how we cook. It could soon change the way we live and work too, with implications for housing and homelessness. This article will explore some of the possibilities. 
One idea is that technology could help to create more affordable housing by providing a more accurate representation of what people actually need and want in their homes. Another possibility is that it could help individuals or groups who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to find new homes, either through advertizing or directly working with landlords. 

All of these ideas are just starting to be considered, and there are still many questions remaining about how they will be implemented. However, if done correctly, these changes could have positive impacts on both individuals and groups who need housing but don't currently have it.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are crucial to any startup or organization. They can provide the spark that ignites a new idea, or provide a way to focus on an existing problem and start solving it. By definition, big ideas are large enough to be considered as a serious possibility, but also small enough that they don’t disrupt or take over a company’s day-to-day operations. Here are three examples of big ideas that have helped startups and organizations grow:
1. Social media: A major driver of growth for startups is the ability to connect with customers on a personal level. By understanding how people use social media, companies can develop marketing strategies that work better for their target audience and create more engaging content.

2. Mobile app development: Another key element of growth for startups is creating innovative mobile apps that appeal to a wider range of users.
