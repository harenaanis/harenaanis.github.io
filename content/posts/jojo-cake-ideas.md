Idea 2: Reflect on your favorite memories
What are your favorite memories? What makes them so special? What do they make you feel on a deep level? These are all good questions to ask yourself, and the answers will help you shape your ideas into something truly unique. Here are a few examples: 
1. One of my favorite memories is of when I was a little girl and my family went on an overnight camping trip. It was such an amazing experience to be with my parents and see the country in all its glory. It still makes me emotional to think about it now. 
2. Another great memory from childhood is going skating with my friends in our local park. skating on winter days was one of the best things ever! Even though it's been years since that experience, I can still feel the excitement and happiness that came along with it.
