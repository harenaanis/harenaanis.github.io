Summary: What are some creative ideas, and how should you go about using them?
Creative ideas can be anything from simple changes to whole new directions. However, there are a few key things to keep in mind when using creative ideas. First, make sure that the idea is something that you would want to try out yourself. If it is something that you know how to do, testing it out on a small scale may be all that is needed. Second, make sure the idea has potential for being executed well. A good way to make sure this is to see if people have already come up with similar ideas or if there are any specific ways that the idea could be improved upon. Lastly, make sure that the idea has potential for success. This means seeing if it can actually be done and also seeing if people are willing to pay attention to it. Finally, remember to keep things fun!

Product/Service sections: What problems do you think need to be solved in order to make a better product or service?
There are a number of things that need to be solved in order to make a better product or service. One area where new ideas could help is in the area of customer service. Many people feel that the service that they receive when purchasing a product is not up to par and this is especially true when it comes to online services. This problem needs to be addressed in order for people to feel confident with their purchase. Another issue that needs to be solved is with the way products are offered. It can be difficult for customers to figure out what they are buying, especially when it comes to digital products. A solution could be to offer more information on each product, as well as give customers the ability to return any product if they are not satisfied.
