The benefits of being creative:
According to a study done by the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, being creative has many benefits. Some of these benefits include: improved communication skills, better problem solving abilities, higher grades in school and increased self-esteem.
Being creative can help you communicate better. When you have an idea, you have to be able to explain it to others clearly so they can understand what you’re trying to say. This requires good communication skills.

Being creative can also help you solve problems better. If you can think outside the box, you’ll be able to come up with solutions that others might not think of. This is a valuable skill in any field.

Finally, being creative can lead to higher grades in school.

Trends for Work/Life Balance
In the next few years, many people are looking for ways to balance work and personal lives. Here are some ideas for ways to make work life easier for everyone: 1. Make work a non-essential part of your day. This means that you should only be working when it is necessary and from what you are best suited for. If you have time off during the week, use it to take care of yourself or do something that you enjoy. 2. Try using technology instead of avoiding it. Technology can be a great way to stay connected with friends and family, but it also can keep you from getting too involved with work. Make sure to set boundaries so that your time on the computer is only used for necessary tasks and not idle chat or gaming. 3. Find a job that fit both your skills and interests.
