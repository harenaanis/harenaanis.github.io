Results: How does your new DIY project turn out?
In the world of DIY projects, there are a lot of different ways to go about them. Whether you're just starting out or have some experience, here are three tips to help make your DIY project turn out successfully:
1. Make sure you understand what you're doing before beginning. If you don't know what you're working with, it's more difficult to do a good job and be efficient.

2. Follow the directions as closely as possible. If there are any changes that need to be made, make them and keep track of where they're located so that you can easily refer to them when things start going wrong.

3. Be patient and organized. That's especially important if you want your project to last longer than expected.

What can we do to prepare for 2020?
It has been announced that the United States will be leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2020. This decision is a result of the US president, Donald Trump, wanting to reduce trade deficits and increase economic growth. The main challenge for many countries planning for 2020 is how to prepare for this event. Here are some ideas to help: 
1. Make sure you have an idea of what your country’s trade deficit is. This information can be found on various websites or by talking to your business or government officials. 
2. Get involved in tariff debates with other countries. This can help you develop agreements that will protect your industry from new tariffs being placed by other countries. 
3. Do research on future trends in trade. By doing this, you will be able to identify any potential problems that may arise during the 2020 WTO membership negotiations.
