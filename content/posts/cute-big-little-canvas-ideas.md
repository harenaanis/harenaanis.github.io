What is creative art and why should you care?
Creative art is a form of art that uses imagination and creativity to create something new. By definition, creative art is any art that is created using the power of imagination and creativity. There are many types of creative art, including photography, painting, poetry, sculpture, and music. Each artist creates their own unique brand of creative art.
There are several reasons why you should care about creative art. First, creative artists often use their own imagination and creativity to create new works of art. This can be very rewarding because it allows them to explore their repertoire of skills in a way that they may not have been able to do with other forms of artistic expression. Second, creative artists often experiment with ideas and techniques that other artists might not consider. This can lead to interesting outcomes that you might not have found if you were just looking for traditional Approaches to Art.

creativity: How do you improve your invention ideas?
Creativity is essential to any invention. Every step of the process from Ideation to Execution should be tailored to increase creativity and improve the chances of a successful product. Here are four tips for improving your invention ideas:
1. Be persistent
Inevitably, every invention will not be perfect. That’s okay! The important thing is that you keep trying and learning until you find something that works well and can be improved upon. Keep a notebook or digital sketchbook where you can jot down ideas as they come to you, so you have access to them when needed. This way, you won’t get lost in your work and can focus on what really matters- developing a great product.

2. Be open to feedback
Feedback is key in ANY creative process.
