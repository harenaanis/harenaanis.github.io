2. Take a step back: Sometimes it’s best to take a step back and rethink an idea because you may not have thought of it before. This can help you develop more creativity because you aren’t just focused on the immediate problem.
3. Look at examples: When you see good examples of how others have done something, it can make it easier for you to come up with your own idea.

How do you think about creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be hard to come by, but they can also be some of the most fun you ever have. If you're looking for ways to spice up your life or simply come up with new and creative ideas, here are a few tips. 
Start with brainstorming: This step is all about taking your creativity and turning it into something productive. What do you think could be done better? What would make this idea more interesting? Once you've narrowed it down, start thinking about how to make it happen. 

Take a look at examples: Another great way to get started is by taking a look at other people's work. What do they do that you don't? How can you improve on what they did? Once you have some inspiration, it's time to start coming up with your own ideas.
