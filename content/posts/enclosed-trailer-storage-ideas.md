Printing press
In 1439, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, which revolutionized how information was disseminated. For the first time in history, knowledge was not restricted to those who could read and write; it could be shared with anyone who could operate a printing press. The ability to mass-produce printed materials quickly and cheaply made it possible for people to access a wide range of information that was previously only available to a select few.
The invention of the printing press had a profound impact on society. It allowed for the rapid spread of ideas and knowledge, and played a key role in shaping the course of history. Today, the printing press is an essential tool for businesses, schools, and individuals around the world.

Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.

Ideas in Action: How to start using your ideas
How to start using your ideas? It can be difficult finding the right inspiration, but with a little effort and creativity, you can get started on anything. Here are three ways to get started:
