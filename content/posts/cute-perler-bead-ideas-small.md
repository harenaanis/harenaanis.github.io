Invention: How does invention change the world?
Invention has changed the way we live and work, and it could soon change the world again. With new methods of technology coming up every day, it’s hard to predict how innovation will impact our lives in the future. But with some careful planning, there is no doubt that invention will have a large impact on society as a whole. 
For example, imagine a world where cars were not relying on gasoline or oil to run. Instead, they would be powered by electricity or wind energy. This would slash fuel costs and improve air quality around the world. 

Similarly, imagine a world without farm animals. We would be able to produce more food without them and reduce water usage because we wouldn’t need to pour water onto fields just to get food for our animals. 

 Invention could also have an even larger impact on our planet.

Types of innovation: What are some types of innovations that businesses commonly use?
Innovation is a process of change that leads to the creation of new products, services, or economy. There are many different types of innovation, but four common types are product innovation, service innovation, market innovation, and business model innovation. 
Product Innovation: Product innovations are changes in the physical form of something that makes it more accessible or useful to consumers. For example, Google created Street View in order to allow people to see how their cities look from close up. This type of innovation is often used for education and marketing purposes. Service Innovation: Service innovations are changes in the way services are delivered to customers. For example, Apple Watch was developed as a way for people to keep track of their time and step-by-step exercises without having to carry a phone around. This type of innovation is often used for health and fitness applications.
