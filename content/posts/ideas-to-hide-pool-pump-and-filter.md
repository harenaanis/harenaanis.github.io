Patent applications: What are the most common types of patent applications?
Patent applications are the single most common type of document filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). They account for about 60% of all patent filings, and they are also the most popular type of application.
There are many different types of patent applications, but three main types are: utility patents, design patents, and copyrights. Each has its own specific benefits and drawbacks, so it's important to understand which type is best for your product or idea.

 Utility patents are the most common type of patent application, and they're used to protect ideas that have no practical use yet but could be very beneficial in the future. For example, a company might file a utility patent for a new product that can help cut energy costs.

Design patents protect specific features or designs of products.

In some cases, this can be an extended period of time - for example, if someone has been thinking about the same subject constantly for a few days or weeks. In other cases, it may be more sporadic - for example, if someone thinks about the same topic once and then doesn't think about it for a week or two.

Discussion: How can we find and use the best ideas for our goals?
If you're like most people, you have some goals that you want to achieve. However, what do you do with the ideas for achieving those goals? 
There are a lot of ways to find and use the best ideas for your goals, but here are four that may be particularly helpful: 

1) Look at what others have accomplished - This is probably the simplest way to find good ideas, as it's all around us. When looking at what others have done, ask yourself how could you perform better or accomplish more of the same? What was their goal? What did they do to achieve it? You'll likely find a lot of great ideas in this category. 
2) Brainstorm - Brainstorming is another great way to come up with new ideas. Again, ask yourself why something might be an effective approach or solution.

The Idea behind an Invention: What is it?
Inventions are things that have been made to make our lives easier or faster. They can be things as simple as a new way to pleasure ourselves or something more complex like the invention of the printing press which allowed for masses of documentation to be created and shared easily. There is no limit to the number of inventions that can be made, it just takes some creativity and hard work to come up with them.
