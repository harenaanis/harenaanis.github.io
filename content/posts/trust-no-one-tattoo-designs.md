How do we create innovation?
Innovation is a process of thought, creativity and change that occurs in any company. It can be found in everything from the smallest idea to the biggest product. To create innovation, it’s important to have a clear definition of what you want your product or service to achieve, as well as how you plan on achieving it. Additionally, it’s essential to have a clear vision for the future and how your product or service will help make that vision a reality. Lastly, it’s essential to keep all of these things in mind when developing your product or service – otherwise you may find yourself at risk of becoming stagnant in your industry or at risk of becoming irrelevant.

How to make simple changes that can improve your home
Making simple changes to your home can improve its overall design, function and livability. Here are a few tips to get you started: 
1. Remove any obstacles from your way - remove any fliers, posters or other adornments that areinghamatairport-style wallpaper or carpets. You don't need them and they can add clutter and unsightliness. 
2. Make the living area more inviting - create a dividers wall between the bedroom and living room if you have one and make use of natural light instead of artificial light fixtures. This will help to create a more relaxing environment for spending time in your home. 
3. Add some storage - adding some storage boxes, cupboards or other containers on either end of the couch can seem like a small change, but it can make a big impact in how your home feels and looks.
