But what some people might call "brainstroming" – the sudden onset of intense thought or activity – is actually a natural process that happens when your brain is in overdrive. The intensity of thought or activity can be helpful if you are trying to focus on a task, but it can also be stressful if you're working on too many things at once.

Definition: Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality.
Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality. This includes both expressively creative art and abstraction. Expressively creative art often uses creativity to escape from reality. An example of this would be a painting that doesn't represent a real-world object, but instead usesimagery or myth to create a unique experience. An example of an abstract artist's work could be a painting without any specific objects or movements, allowing the viewer to imagine what it might look like.

The benefits of big ideas: How do they benefit society as a whole?
Big Ideas offer a way to think outside the box and come up with new ideas that can improve society as a whole. There are many benefits to big ideas, both private and public. Here are three of the most common: 
1) They inspire people to think about how they can improve their community and themselves. Big Ideas encourage people to question why things are the way they are and look for ways to make their world a better place. This can lead to change, both in the individual and community levels.

2) They help us confront problems we might not have seen before. Big Ideas give us new perspectives on how to solve problems and bring about change. This can be exciting because it allows us to see solutions that we might not have considered before.

3) They help us connect with others who share our same goals or values.
