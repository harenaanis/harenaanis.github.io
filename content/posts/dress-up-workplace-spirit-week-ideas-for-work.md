How can we come up with big ideas?
The best ideas come from a brainstorming session. Sometimes, it’s just easier to think broad thoughts when you have a lot of different ideas in your head. Here are some tips on how to come up with big ideas:
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of different ideas in your head, it can be difficult to remember which ones are the most important. The best way to organize these ideas is by having a main idea and then going from there. This will help you keep track of what you’re working on and make sure that it’s always relevant to your main idea.

2. Take advantage of technology: Technology has helped us massively in the past when it comes to coming up with big ideas. By using tools like Google Earth or yellow boards, we can easily brainstorm and keep track of our thoughts as we go.
