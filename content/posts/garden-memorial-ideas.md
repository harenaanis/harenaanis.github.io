Research: How to do research to find inventions that can be used.
Invention ideas are a plentiful resource for businesses. The word “invention” can be used to describe anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. However, when it comes to invention research, there are key steps that must be followed in order to find potential products or services that could be used in business. 
One important step in finding inventions is understanding the target market. This means knowing what customers want and how they would use a new product or service. Additionally, it is important to understand the technology behind the product or service in order to create an idea for potential customers. 

Once an idea has been created, it is important to find someone who can test and market the product. This person can help identify any potential consumer problems and potentially create marketing materials that could be helpful in building sales.
