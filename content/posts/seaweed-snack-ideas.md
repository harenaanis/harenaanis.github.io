Patent applications are a common way to get your ideas out into the public domain. They can also be a way to protect your intellectual property and increase your chances of getting paid for your innovations. Here are some tips on how to file for an invention: 
- Make sure you have the proper paperwork in order to filing an application. This includes a patent application, published works, and any other supporting information.
