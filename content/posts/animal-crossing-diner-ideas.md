In business, innovation can mean different things to different people, and it can often be tougher than simply coming up with a new idea. Sometimes, companies have to go beyond the basics of product design and development in order to come up with innovative solutions.

Inspiration from nature:
Creative ideas come from all around nature. Sometimes they are simple, like a flower that can be picked up with your hands, or an animal that is easy to look at but hard to understand. Other times they are more complicated, like the way a tree grows or the way a bee collects nectar. Whatever creative ideas you come up with, make sure they are based on something you have seen in nature and that you can understand.

Immigration and globalization: What are the biggest issues facing our economy and world today? (As well as future plans for these topics)
As a global community, we must take into account the effects of immigration on our economy and world today. Our policies can help to shape this future by accommodating different types of immigrants and employing them in a way that benefits both newcomers and society as a whole. Additionally, we need to continue to promote open borders so that everyone can come if they wish, and explore ways to reduce the number of refugees coming into our world.
