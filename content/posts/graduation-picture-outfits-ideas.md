How to have big ideas
1. Want to have big ideas? You need to start by opening your mind. Be curious about the world around you and constantly ask yourself questions. Why does this happen? How could things be done better? When you're constantly challenging yourself to think differently, you'll start having bigger and better ideas.
2. It's also important to take risks. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things, even if they seem a little crazy at first. The best ideas often come from thinking outside the box. So go ahead and let your imagination run wild!

3. Finally, don't forget to share your ideas with others. brainstorming with friends or colleagues can help you develop your ideas further and turn them into reality. So don't be afraid to speak up - your big idea could change the world!

The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.
