Technology has a vast array of advantages in the innovation process, including making it easier to find and use ideas, leading to quicker decisions, and allowing companies to better track their progress. However, it can also be dangerous if not used properly. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of companies incorporating technology into their business processes in order to speed up the innovation process. Here are three examples of how this could be beneficial for businesses:

This allows businesses to make better decisions about where to allocate their resources and reduce wastage.
