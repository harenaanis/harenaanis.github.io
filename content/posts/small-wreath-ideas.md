what is an invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, a process, or a service. It’s an important part of the business world, and it can be a lot of fun.
There are four main steps to inventing something: idea generation, development, prototyping, and commercialization. First, you have to come up with an idea for something new. This can be inspired by a problem you’ve noticed that needs solving, or by something you think would be cool or helpful to have. Once you have an idea, you need to develop it into a concept that can be turned into a physical product or service. This involves doing market research and feasibility studies to make sure your idea is viable and there’s demand for it.

Creative Approaches to Ideas: 1. Brainstorming: Start by brainstorming all the possible ways that your idea could be developed. What are some ideas for stories, designs, products, or services?

Hypothesis: Now that you've explored what you like and don't like about your idea, it's time to come up with an introspective hypothesis about why people might want to use your product or service.
