Origins of innovation: How has it been developed over time?
Innovation is a process that starts with a problem and then comes up with a creative solution to it. It is the result of creativity and the willingness to learn from your mistakes. Innovation is a key factor in economic growth, according to some experts. The history of innovation can be traced back to ancient Greece, where thinkers such as Socrates and Aristotle were fighting for ideas that would improve society. In China, the first written mention of innovation can be found in an account from the 3rd century BC written by Lu Cang. In Japan, it was only after Emperor Taishō made education compulsory in 1868 that people began to learn about innovation. In the 20th century, innovation was widely accepted by society and was considered part of the natural order of things. However, during World Wars II, there was a major shift in how innovation was viewed by both sides.

The 4 types of creativity: Intrinsic, extrinsic, creative accident, and creative process.
Creative process is the sum total of all the steps that go into producing a work of art. Intrinsic creativity comes from within; extrinsic creativity is based on external factors, such as the environment or the people around someone. Creative accidents happen when something goes wrong while trying to create something, usually resulting in a new and different way of looking at things. The creative process is a never-ending journey, and it can be unpredictable.

The Future of Invention: What We Can Expect from Its explosive Growth
Invention is one of the most powerful tools humanity has at its disposal. It can solve some of the world's biggest problems- from developing new drugs to design new transportation systems. But as it grows ever more popular, innovation may also come at a cost. If scientists and entrepreneurs don't keep up with the pace of invention, they could lose out on key opportunities to make a significant impact on society.
That's why it's important for society to continue to invest in innovation- not just because it helps us solve big problems, but because it can help us create new ways of life that are better for everyone. That's what we should expect from Invention's explosive growth.
