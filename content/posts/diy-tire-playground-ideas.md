What does creativity have to do with art? A lot, actually. In order for an artist to create a piece of art, they must be creative. This means that they must be able to see things in a different way than most people and come up with new ideas. It also means that they must be able to communicate these ideas to other people. Finally, it means that they must be able to execute these ideas effectively.
