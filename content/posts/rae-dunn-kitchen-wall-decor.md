How did Invention get started?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or product. It started with the invention of the printing press in 1453, and has since grown to include everything from bicycles to vacuum cleaners. Inventions have helped make our lives easier, and have even had a huge impact on the world around us. We can thank inventions for some of the most significant moments in human history, such as the development of democracy and the automobile.
