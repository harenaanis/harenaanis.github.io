Definition of innovation: How can it be used in business?
Innovation is the process of creating a new product, service or idea that is different from the existing ones. Innovation can be used in business in different ways and can be seen as a way to improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue and create new opportunities for businesses. There are many different types of innovation, but three main types are product innovation, service innovation and market niche innovation. Product Innovation: Product innovation occurs when a company creates a new product that better meets the needs of their customers. This can involve developing a new type of product, designing an innovative marketing strategy or even coming up with a unique idea for a product. Service Innovation: Service innovation occurs when companies create new services that meet the needs of their customers better than those currently available. This could involve creating innovative delivery methods or providing unique services that don't exist elsewhere.
