Definition of creativity: What makes something creative?
Creativity is the ability of an individual to think outside the box and come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. It can be found in any form, from creative writing to architectural design. To many, creativity is seen as a verb, meaning that someone does something creative in order to produce something new. However, for some, creativity stems from the act of thinking, rather than doing. This definition of creativity is flexible and can be used for any type of artistic work.
