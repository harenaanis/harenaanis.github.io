How do we come up with big ideas?
Ideas are a vital part of any business, and when it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. First, big ideas should be purposeful and tailored to the needs of your business. You must also have a clear plan for how you will execute on them, as well as the resources necessary to make them a reality. Finally, it’s important to remember that big ideas often require more than one person or even several teams to come up with them. As such, always be prepared to listen and learn from others who may have experience working on large projects.
