4. The finished Product: How does the finished product stack up against other options?
When looking at options for homebuilding, it can be hard to decide which one is the best for you. Whether you're looking to start a home from scratch or just update an existing one, there are a number of different options available. 
One option is to go with a pre-made home. These homes come pre-assembled and can be used in a variety of ways. Some people find them easy to use and others find them more difficult to work with. The final product will likely vary based on the person's preferences. 

Another option is to build your own home. This process can be expensive but it can also be fun and rewarding. There are many different things you can do to help make this process easier such as finding a contractor who specializes in building homes from scratch or finding online resources that can guide you through the process.

The bottom line: the benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are well-documented and undisputed. Brainstorming allows individuals to generate new ideas, build on existing ideas, and create solutions to problems. Brainstorming also fosters creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.
Despite the clear benefits of brainstorming, many people still hesitate to engage in this type of thinking. One reason for this may be the fear of judgement or criticism. Others may simply not know how to brainstorm effectively.

Fortunately, there are a few simple guidelines that can help make brainstorming more productive and less intimidating. First, it is important to suspend judgement during the brainstorming process. This means that all ideas should be welcomed and explored, no matter how “out there” they may seem at first. Secondly, it is helpful to set a time limit for each brainstorming session.

Discussion: What could we do to improve our idea process?
New ideas often come about during brainstorming sessions, and can be a great way to improve our idea process. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas on your own. Here are three tips on how to get started:
1. Get feedback from others: When brainstorming, it’s important to take input from other members of the team. This will help you develop ideas that are both based on common interest and workable.

2. Be open to change: sometimes the best ideas don’t fit into what we’ve been told before. Be willing to change your opinion if something seems better or more feasible.

3. Be persistent: despite sometimes being frustrating, nothing is more important than making sure our idea is implemented successfully. Keep at it until you have a great list of proposals that everyone is happy with!
