How to have big ideas
The ability to have big ideas is a skill that can be learned and cultivated. Here are some tips on how to have big ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas and perspectives. Don't be afraid to explore different viewpoints and challenge your own assumptions.

2. Pay attention to your surroundings and the world around you. Look for patterns and connections that you may not have noticed before.

3. Be willing to take risks. Big ideas often come from thinking outside the box and taking risks. So don't be afraid to try something new or different.

4. Be persistent and never give up. Many great ideas come after many failed attempts. So keep trying and never give up on your dreams or goals.

5. Surround yourself with other creative people.

Patenting an invention: What is the process?
Patenting an invention can be a complex process, but there are key steps that are typically followed. Inventors typically create a patent application, which is then submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The USPTO will review the application and decide whether to issue a patent or not. If the USPTO decides to issue a patent, the inventor must then file a full U.S. Patent Act lawsuit against someone who has already registered their trade mark or copyrighted their invention.
