What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a big help when it comes to solving problems. Ideas can also help you see things in a new light or come up with new ideas for projects. There are many benefits to having ideas and some people swear by the power of them. Here are three reasons why you should try out ideas at least once: 
- When you have an idea, it can force you to think about what else could be done. This can lead to new ideas, which in turn can lead to new projects. 
- Ideas are often more efficient than what is currently being done. When you have an idea, you can get started on it even if it’s not perfect and that makes the process of learning more efficient. 
- Ideas give people the opportunity to share their thoughts and opinions with others.

What are some bad ideas?
The following are some bad ideas that people come up with all the time. Some of these ideas are really stupid and not good for anything, but they get thrown around a lot and people think they might be good. So, here are some of the worst ideas:

2) Giving away free stuff. This is another bad idea because it won’t help anyone and it’s going to make people less likely to buy things.

4) making school harder than necessary.
