The Invention of the Telephone
In 1876, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail developed a signaling system that could be used to send messages over the air. This system, called the telegraph, allowed for communication between distant locations without having to rely on intermediaries. The telephone was created in 1877, when inventor John Ambrose Fleming developed a technology that allowed voice calls over the telephone line.
