A few Tips for Using Brainstroming to Improve Your Life
Brainstroming can help improve your thinking and productivity, especially if you're struggling with a specific problem or goal. Here are a few tips for using brainstroming to get started: 
1. Get organized: Brainstroming can help you focus on one task at a time, which can make it easier to succeed at your goal. Keep track of your thoughts and ideas in an easily accessible place, and use that information to jumpstart your brainstorming process.
