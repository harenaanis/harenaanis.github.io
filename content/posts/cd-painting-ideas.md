What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to taking the opposite approach to an existing idea and seeing what happens. Sometimes these ideas can come from simply thinking about something different and seeing what comes out. There are so many creative ideas out there it's hard to know where to start! Here are a few examples: 
1. Try a new perspective on an old problem. When you look at something from a different angle, often the solution is obvious but you may not have thought of it before. This is where creativity comes in – trying things that others may have thought of as impossible or not worth trying. 
2. Make something that no one has ever done before. Something that is different but also traditional or familiar enough so people can feel comfortable with using it.

There is a new idea that could be implemented in the healthcare industry that is called electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs are a type of online system where patients can keep track of their health information and see updated information about their care. This would free up doctor’s time to focus on more important tasks, such as patient examination and treatment. Additionally, it would make it easier for nurses to communicate with doctors, since they would have access to all the information the patient has on their record.
