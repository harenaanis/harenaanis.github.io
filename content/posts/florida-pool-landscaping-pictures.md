The Challenge of Innovation: How do we stay ahead of the curve?
Innovation is a challenge for any organization, but it's especially hard to keep up with the curve when it comes to technology. Many times, innovation can come from scratch or from taking an existing product and changing its features or design. But whether it's something as simple as a new way of packaging food or a transformed business model, staying ahead of the curve can be tricky.
One way to overcome this challenge is to build on what others have done before. This can be done through collaboration and learning from others, as well as by listening carefully to what customers want and need. It's also important to focus on what customers want most, rather than just trying to please everyone.

There are several ways that an organization can stay ahead of the curve when it comes to innovation.

How does brainstroming work?
Are you a morning person or an evening person? A night owl or a morning owl? How do you know which type of person your brainstroming is? Scientists have developed a way to measure the activity in the brainstem and it is based on what time of day someone is. This research has been published in "PLoS One" and was done by scientists at the University of Utah."
Brainstroming, also known as brainwave synchronization, is a process that occurs during sleep when different parts of the brain work together. Brainstroming helps to improve focus and concentration, make decisions faster, and achieve goals. The study found that people who are morning people tend to have more brainstroming than those who are evening people. People who are night owls also have more brainstroming than those who are morning owls.
