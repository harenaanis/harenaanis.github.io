The benefits of brainstorming
Brainstorming is a great way to generate new ideas, and can be done either alone or in a group. When brainstorming, it is important to suspend judgment and allow all ideas to be considered. This can help prevent “groupthink”, where people only consider ideas that are similar to what they already know. Brainstorming can also help people come up with creative solutions to problems.
There are many different ways to brainstorm, but one popular method is called “brainstorming by free association”. This involves coming up with words or phrases that are related to the topic at hand, and then using those words or phrases to generate new ideas. Another method is called “brainstorming by analogy”, which involves thinking of similar situations or problems and how they were solved.

Top 5 priorities when renovating or upgrading: What are some things you should consider before starting any renovation project?
Renovating or upgrading your home can seem daunting, but with some easy diy ideas and a bit of creativity, it can be a breeze. Here are five top priorities when renovating or upgrading: 
1. Choose the right renovation project: The first step is to choose the right renovation project for your needs. Do you want to update your home for its next generation or restore it to its former glory? There are many options and consequences to each decision, so consult with a professional before starting any renovation. 
2. Get pre-approved: Once you've chosen the project you want to undertake, it's time to get pre-approved from your local building authority or other approvals required for the type of renovation you want to do. This way, you'll know exactly what permits and regulations will be necessary in order to complete the project without any surprises later on.
