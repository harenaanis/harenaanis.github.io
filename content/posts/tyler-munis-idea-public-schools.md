Creative process is the process that goes behind the creation of any artwork. This can be anything from a simple idea to a masterpiece. There are many different steps that go into creating an artwork, and it can be difficult to determine which one is responsible for the finished product. However, some key steps in the creative process include:
1. Brainstorming: Brainstorming is when you come up with ideas for art and discuss them with others. This helps you come up with new ideas and ways to improve upon old ones.

2. coming up with details: Once you have brainstormed, it’s important to start coming up with specific ideas for your work. This includes making sure your images are clear, considering how your work will be displayed, and figuring out what type of paper or canvas you’ll need to create your artwork on.

Technology used in Invention: What are the benefits of using invention?
Invention has many benefits, including reducing costs and time associated with traditional business processes. Additionally, invention can help companies achieve new heights in their industries. However, as with any tool or process, there are drawbacks to using invention for all purposes. Here are five of the most important: 
1) Invention can be limiting in its application: Sometimes, the use of invention results in limitations on what others can do. For example, a company might not be able to produce a product that is as large or successful as they could have been if they used other methods. 
2) Invention can be distracting: Invention often leaves companies feeling like they're "working on something™" instead of actually doing anything productive. This can lead to tension and stress within the workplace, which could have negative consequences for both employees and businesses.
