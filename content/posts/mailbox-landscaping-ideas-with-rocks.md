Some common problems that can be caused by poor problem solving technique:
When it comes to problem solving, one of the most important techniques is brainstroming. Brainstroming is a process of using your thoughts and ideas to brainstorm solutions to problems. It’s a great way to come up with potential solutions and get started on solving a problem. However, there are some common problems that can be caused by poor problem solving technique. Here are five examples:
1) You don’t have enough time: Brainstroming is supposed to be a process that takes around 20 minutes. If you’re trying to solve a problem that’s taking longer than that, you may not have enough time left to come up with solutions.

2) You don’t know what you’re looking for: WhenBrainstroming, you need to be specific about what you want to come up with.
