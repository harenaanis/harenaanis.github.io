History of innovation:
The history of innovation is filled with stories of people who have inspired and changed the way we live and work. Some of these innovative thinkers have had a lasting impact on society, while others have faded into obscurity. But all of them have left their mark on history in some way. Here are 5 examples.
1) Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the movable type press in 1455 led to the printing press and the rise of printing technology as an important part of modern society.

2) In 1876, Bell Labs invented the telephone, which made communication much more accessible than it had been before.

3) The internet was first created in 1972 by mathematician Alain Robert et al., which allowed for greater access to information and education than ever before.
