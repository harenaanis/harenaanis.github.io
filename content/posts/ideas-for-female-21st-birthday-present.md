How do you come up with big ideas?
Many people come up with big ideas on their own. However, it can be difficult to come up with ideas that are both original and exciting. There are a few things that you can do to help increase your chances of coming up with big ideas. One is to think about what other people have done or are doing that you would like to emulate. Another is to develop a plan or idea for something and then go ahead and create a prototype of it.

Introduce the topic of ideas.
There are a lot of ideas out there. Some are good, and some are bad. But how do you know which ones are worth your time? In this article, we'll introduce the topic of ideas and explore some ways to tell if an idea is worth your time.
First, let's define what we mean by "idea." An idea is a potential solution to a problem or a new way of doing something. It's something that you can turn into reality with enough effort.

Not all ideas are created equal. Some ideas are better than others. To evaluate an idea, ask yourself these questions:

-Does this idea solve a real problem?
-Is this idea original?
-Is this idea feasible?
-Is this idea valuable?
