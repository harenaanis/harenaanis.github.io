Immigration and globalization: How will these issues affect the workforce and social stability?

This has led to a rise in the number of jobs available in these countries, but also a decrease in the number of people who can actually fill them. Additionally, the growth of technology has made it easier for people to move around the world, which has created new opportunities for those who are unable or unwilling to find work in their home country. These changing demographics will have a significant impact on both the workforce and social stability.
