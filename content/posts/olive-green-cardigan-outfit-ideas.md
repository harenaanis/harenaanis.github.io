What is the definition of big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can also be difficult to come by. There are a few things that make big ideas successful, and those things depend on the individual. Some people find it easy to come up with big ideas, while others may have to work hard to come up with them.
The most important thing is that big ideas should have a clear vision and purpose. They need to be interesting and useful, and they should be something that people can be excited about. Once they’re developed, big ideas need to be abandoned if they don’t meet these requirements.

If you want to find out what makes big ideas successful, you need to ask yourself a few questions. What are your goals? What does the audience want? What do you think will make the idea interesting and user-friendly? Are you worried about potential roadblocks or problems?

1. Idea Submission: How do you go about submitting an idea?
When you want to submit an idea to a news outlet, there are a few things you need to do in order to make sure your submission is accepted. 
You first need to create a proposal, which will include information about the idea and why it should be included in the outlet's story. You can also find resources online that can help you with this process, such as The White House's website or the National Broadcasting Corporation's website. 
Next, you need to go through an editing process and make sure your idea is ready for publication. This may involve some changes, but it is important that your submission meets all requirements before it is sent for review. 
Once your idea has been edited and approved by staff at the outlet, you will then need to promote and sell your submission to potential customers.
