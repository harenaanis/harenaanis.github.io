The definition of creativity: How does it differ from other definitions?
Creativity is a field that encompasses many different definitions, but all of them share one common goal: to produce something new. Whether it’s creativity in the creative process itself or what people mean when they use the word, creativity can be defined in many ways. 
There are many different ways to define creativity, but all of them outline four core concepts: 1) The ability to take inspiration from others and create something new; 2) The ability to come up with solutions that haven’t been tried before; 3) The willingness to experiment and try new things; and 4) The drive to learn and grow. 

The definition of creativity can be very different depending on who you ask, but all of these core concepts are key when examining how creativity is defined in the world.
