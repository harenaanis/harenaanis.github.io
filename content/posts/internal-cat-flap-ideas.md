Origins of creativity: How did human beings become able to be creative?
Creativity has a long and complex history, dating back to the Egyptians and Greeks. However, it is only in the last few centuries that scientists have been able to scientifically explore its origins. One oft-mentioned theory is that creativity comes from the need for a new way of looking at things, or from a need to solve a problem. Another theory suggests that creativity comes from the innate potential of people.
