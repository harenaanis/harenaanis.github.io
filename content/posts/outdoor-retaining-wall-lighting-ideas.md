The Importance of Being Creative: Why it's important to be creative when coming up with invention ideas.
Coming up with invention ideas requires a lot of creativity. After all, if you can't think of something new, you'll never be able to invent it.
But why is creativity so important when it comes to invention? For one, it allows you to come up with ideas that are truly original. And when you have an original idea, you're more likely to succeed because no one else has thought of it before.

Plus, being creative means that you're not afraid to take risks. And taking risks is essential when it comes to inventing something new. If you're not willing to take risks, you'll never achieve anything great.

So next time you're feeling stuck, remember that being creative is the key to coming up with invention ideas that are truly innovative and unique.

What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from a new way of looking at an old problem, to coming up with a new business idea. Whether you’re brainstorming for your next project or just need a break from reality, creative ideas can help you get anything done. So what are some of your favorite creative ideas? Here are a few examples: 
1) Taking things one step further: When you come up with an original idea, don’t stop there. What could the world do with another perspective? Try taking something that people usually do and make it their own. This will give your idea more life and make it more unique. 
2) Breaking the mold: When it comes to business, there is no “safe” route when it comes to starting a company.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
