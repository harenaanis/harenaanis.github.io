legal aspects of Invention: What are the rules surrounding invention?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea,product or method. It can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is that invention is "the creation of something new out of nothing." Many countries have laws that regulate the creation and use of inventions. In some cases, these laws are more important than others, and they can play a decisive role in whether an invention becomes a commercial success.
There are three types of law governing invention: trade secrets, copyrights and patents.trade secrets usually relate to technology or business ideas, while copyrights protect creative works such as novels, motion pictures and computer programs. Patents allow inventors to exclusive use their ideas for a period of time, which can make it difficult for other people to adopt or use an invention.

Ideas for inventions: What are some good ideas?
Invention ideas are always something to think about, especially when it comes to new technology or products. There are many different ways to come up with ideas for inventions, so there is no one right way. Here are some great ways to come up with new inventions: 
1. Developing a prototype – This can be done in many different ways, but often a Prototype will help you test the idea and see if it works. It can also help you determine how much money or time it will take to make the product real. 
2. Utilizing existing technology – If you have an existing product or technology that can be used in an invention, this is a great option. Not only will this give you a lot of ideas, but it can also save you time and money.

1. criteria your idea must meet: your target market, what they need, how you can improve on what they have already done
2. come up with a detailed plan: make sure your idea is unique and solves a problem that the target market knows exists
3. test it: do people actually use what you’ve come up with? If not, refining it will cost time and money

Creativity is a key part of life and can be used to come up with new ideas, solve problems, and achieve goals. Here are some creative ways to use creativity in your day-to-day life:
1. Get inspired by nature: Look at pictures of natural disasters or scenes from around the world and think of creative ways you could incorporate them into your home or workspace. This can be a great way to bond with nature and get lost in the moment.
2. Try something new: When you have a blank canvas, try painting or sculpting without any preconceptions about what you will end up with. Just go for it! This can help you start thinking outside the box and come up with new ideas that might not have been considered before.
3. Get organized: When it comes to creativity, order is key.
