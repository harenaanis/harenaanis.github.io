Development and commercialization: How do you make money from your invention?
Invention ideas are all around us. Whether it's a new product or an idea for a new company, something can be invented and made into a business. There are many ways to monetize an invention, but there is one way that is always popular and payout: profit sharing. Profit sharing is when an inventor gets a percentage of the sales generated from their invention. It can be a great way to make some extra money while your invention remains in the public domain. There are different types of profit sharing, but one of the most common is share-the- wealth, which means that inventors receive a cut of any profits made by their invention. There are also royalty shares, which give inventors a share of the royalties received from selling their invention.

Businesses and Innovation: How can companies Benefit from Innovation?
Businesses have always been able to benefit from innovation. However, the current economic climate is making it more difficult for companies to receive funding for innovative ideas.
