Conclusion
Innovation is the key to success in any field. It allows businesses to adapt and change their products or services to meet the needs of their customers, and it drives economic growth.
This has been true for many industries, including technology, but it is especially important in the entertainment industry. With so many new technologies being developed every day, there's always room for Innovation to take hold and help companies achieve their goals.

One example of this is the video game industry. In recent years, there have been a number of new games released that are very innovative. One such game is "Destiny." This game is based on the Bible story of Adam and Eve and their attempt to escape from the Garden of Eden.

The three types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, and Exact
Creativity is a result of the interaction between two or more factors. These factors can be called intuition and analysis, or exactly. Intuitive creativity is the result of an individual's natural ability to connect with the world and see patterns. Analytical creativity is founded on reason and analysis, which can help individuals see how things work and how they can be improved. 
Exact creativity is when an individual has a specific idea and they go into deep analysis to make it a reality. This type of creativity often requires focus and dedication, as it can be difficult to change your mind after you have initial ideas. However, if done correctly, this type of creativity can lead to amazing products and solutions.

Introduce the topic of inventions.
Inventions are ideas or objects that are created with the purpose of solving a problem or making life easier. Inventors are people who come up with these ideas and create them.
Some inventions are world-changing, like the telephone or the airplane. Others solve more everyday problems, like a better mousetrap or a self-tying shoelace. No matter how big or small, all inventions start with an idea.

If you have an invention idea, the first step is to figure out if it’s something that people actually need or want. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to start working on making your invention a reality.
