Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are different from those that have been produced before. Innovation can be defined in many ways, but one way to think about it is as a shift in how we look at things. Innovation can mean different options or approaches to problem solving, and it can also include the invention of new methods or technologies.

The role of technology in promoting innovation?
Technology has often been seen as a facilitator of innovation, with the ability to help organizations make faster and more efficient decisions. However, recent studies have shown that technology can also be used in an adversarial role, promoting innovation in the wrong direction. For example, Google was found to be using its search engine to promote its own products instead of those of other companies. In other cases, such as Apple's use of advertising to convince users to buy their products instead of competitors', technology can actually hinder innovation by creating a rift between different factions within an organization.
