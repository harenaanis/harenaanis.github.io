How to come up with ideas
If you're like most people, the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ideas is creativity. However, if you're like most people, coming up with ideas can be a challenge. 
Here are some tips to help come up with great ideas: 
1. Have a clear goal in mind 
Before you can start thinking about ways to achieve your goal, it's important to have a clear goal in mind. This will help you focus on the right things and make sure that your brainstorming process is efficient. 
2. Be organized

How to Make Your Home More Functional
Last year, I was faced with a unique challenge. My home was slowly being used less and less as my office became more and more. To keep up with the trend, I decided to create a few key functional pieces in my home that could help me get more done. Here are some tips on how to make your home more functional: 
1. Make an organized space - One of the most important things you can do to improve your productivity is make sure you have an organized space in which to work. This can be anything from a shelves of books on one side of the room to wires leading out of the windows for potential cable management purposes. 

2. Get rid of distractions - When it comes to working, it’s important to keep things as quiet and distraction-free as possible.
