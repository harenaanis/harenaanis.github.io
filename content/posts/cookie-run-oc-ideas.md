When it comes to being creative, brainstorming is key. This technique allows you to explore all of the ideas in your head without judgement. By writing down every single idea, no matter how absurd it may seem, you open yourself up to possibilities that you may have never considered before. Brainstorming can be done alone or with a group, and it's a great way to generate new ideas.
