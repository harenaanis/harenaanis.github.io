The best ways to be creative
There is no one answer for how to be creative. However, some ways to become more creative include: practicing brainstorming, keeping a journal, and taking on new challenges.
One way to become more creative is to practice brainstorming. Brainstorming is a technique used to generate new ideas. To brainstorm, you can start by asking yourself questions about a topic or problem you are trying to solve.
