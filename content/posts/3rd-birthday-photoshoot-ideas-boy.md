Discussion: Are any of the new ideas feasible or even desirable?
Do any of the new ideas proposed in a new white paper by Google and The New York Times hold promise for improving American society? If so, why are they being considered so cautiously?
Critics say that some of the proposals - such as creating a government-sponsored healthcare system - would be too costly or even unrealistic. Others worry that none of the new ideas will work.

But if a few potential solutions can be put into practice, they may well constitute a more effective way to improve the quality of life for Americans. So far, there is no clear evidence that any of these proposals have actually changed people's lives in meaningful ways.

brain washing: How can people be made to do things they don't want to do?
How can people be made to do things they don't want to do? There are many ways, but some of the most common methods are brainwashing and suggestion. Brainwashing is a process of inducing someone to change their views or behavior by using persuasive techniques. suggesting someone does something based on their eagerness or attraction often works better than actual coercion. Brainwashing techniques typically range from subtle (like reinforcing positive thoughts) to blatant (such as convincing someone that they have no choice in the matter). 
There are a few different types of brainwashing, but the most common is suggestion. Suggestion is when you say something that might make someone do something they wouldn't normally do. For example, if you tell a person they have to go outside for 5 minutes, that might suggest to them that it's time for them to get up and leave.
