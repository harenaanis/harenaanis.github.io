The Benefits of Innovation: What are the benefits for businesses and individuals?
New technologies, such as those that allow businesses to make changes in their products or services without having to go through traditional marketing or product development processes, are often associated with benefits for the business and individual stakeholder groups alike. These new technologies can provide businesses with new markets and customers, faster turnaround times for products or services, increased efficiency and productivity, and new opportunities for innovation. In some cases, these advantages can even lead to competitive advantages over older rivals.
While there are a number of benefits associated with innovation (including creating jobs and boost the economy), it can also have negative effects on businesses if not managed properly. For example, when a company begins using a new technology incorrectly or does not properly validate its results before implementing them in the marketplace, it can result in negative publicity and decreased sales.

Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.
