Regulatory environment for innovation:
Innovation is one of the key drivers of economic growth and social progress. In an innovative regulatory environment, businesses can thrive while complying with norms and regulations. The right regulatory environment is essential for business to succeed, and innovation can happen easily in a healthy regulatory atmosphere. Here are four examples of how a vibrant innovation ecosystem can benefit businesses: 
1) Innovation occurs when companies are able to freely experiment with new products or services in order to find what works best for their customers. This helps them build better products, services, or processes that serve their customers better.
2) Innovation happens when regulators are willing to give companies the freedom they need to innovate. By allowing companies to test new ideas, they can identify which ones work and which don’t. This helps regulators ensure that innovative products and services are available for consumers as well as help businesses stay compliant with regulations.
