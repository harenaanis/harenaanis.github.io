Contributions of invention: What has been done with invention that has changed the world?
Invention has had a profound impact on the world, from the creation of dishes that could be made without cookbooks to modern surgical tools and vehicles. Some inventions have even saved lives, such as the polio vaccine. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in innovation in the field of invention, with new ideas coming out all the time. Here are some of the most innovative inventions of all time:

The benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are vast. By taking the time to brainstorm, you allow yourself to explore all possible options and ideas for a project, task, or goal. This can lead to better decision making, improved efficiency, and increased creativity.
When you brainstorm, you also force yourself to think outside the box and come up with new and innovative ideas. This can spark creativity in other areas of your life as well. Brainstorming is a great way to get all your thoughts out on paper so you can see them clearly and make better decisions.

What are some big ideas?
Big ideas can be everything from initiating change to creating a new product or service. Here are some of the most commonly cited big ideas:
1. Create a new business model: A lot of businesses start with good intentions, but eventually fall short because they don't have a clear plan for how to turn their idea into a reality. One way to overcome this obstacle is to come up with radical new ideas that could help your business succeed.

2. Implement change: Change is always necessary in order for businesses to grow and succeed. Sometimes, it means taking risks that might not be seen as safe or sexy, but it can lead to real results. It's also important to remember that change takes time - sometimes it's best to take things one step at a time so you can make sure your business is on the right track before making any big changes.
