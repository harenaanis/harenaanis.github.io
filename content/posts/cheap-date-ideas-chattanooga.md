Conclusion: What are some ideas for inventions?
Ideas for inventions can come in many forms. Sometimes, an invention is a new way of doing something, like the wheel. Other times, an inventor may come up with a new product, like the iPhone. Whatever the form, there are certain things that must be included in order to make an invention work. These things include creativity, innovation, and feasibility. 
Creativity is important when it comes to Invention ideas. For example, think about how you could come up with a new way to market a product or sell a service. Innovation is key when it comes to Invention ideas as well. If someone has come up with a good idea before but hasn’t been implemented successfully, they can often improve on their design or implementation by coming up with another variation or idea that works better.

Brainstroming: How does it work?
How do brains work? There is no one answer to this question as the workings of the brain are complex and still being studied by scientists today. But, according to some theories, brainstroming may play a role in some aspects of mental activity. Brainstroming is when thoughts or ideas rush through your mind quickly and without any thought process behind them. This can lead to a lot of thinking and problem solving in a short amount of time. In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists don’t really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.
