What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are different from those that have been available before. Innovation can happen in any industry, but it is most commonly found in the technology and business sectors. There are a number of different ways to achieve innovation, but one of the most common methods is through trial and error. This means that early adopters of a new product or service test and experiment with it to see if it works before launching it into the market. In order to be successful, innovation needs to be based on a strong idea, good product design, and efficient execution.

Why do we have them?: how do they originate?
Most of us have had ideas. Some of us have had great ideas, others less so. But where do these ideas come from? How do they originate?
Ideas can come from anywhere and everywhere. They can come from our own minds, or from the minds of other people. They can come from books, movies, or even just casual conversations.

Ideas can also originate from our experiences. We might have a new idea after experiencing something for the first time, or after seeing someone else experience it. Or we might have an idea that comes to us in a dream.

There is no one answer to where ideas come from. They can come from anywhere and anyone. The important thing is what we do with them once we have them.
