What are some common mistakes people make when trying tobrainstrom?
When trying tobrainstrom, some common mistakes people make include not learning from their mistakes, thinking they know what they are doing, and underestimating the power of positive thinking. To help you avoid making these mistakes, here are a few tips: 1. First and foremost, be honest with yourself – ask yourself what specifically made you do something wrong the last time you tried brainstroming. If you can't answer this question, it's probably best not to try it again. Knowing your weaknesses will help you focus on attacking them rather than letting them sit there stagnant. 2. Next, work on your practice skills – if you're someone who struggles with problem-solving or strategy development, make sure to practice these skills regularly. This way, when you finally get started with brainstroming, you'll be well-prepared and comfortable starting out.

How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.
