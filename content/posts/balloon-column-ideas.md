Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new and better ways to do things. It can be found in everything from designing a product to marketing a company. In today's economy, innovation is key to keeping businesses afloat and ensuring their success.
There are many definitions of innovation, but one that has been shown to be most effective is the "eight-legged stool" definition created by Michael Porter.
