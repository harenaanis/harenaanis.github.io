Invention stories: How some inventions were born and others were created
Invention stories are a common occurrence in history. Many inventions were born from the intersection of two or more different ideas and concepts. One invention might be a new way to do something, while another might be a more efficient way to do something. 
One example of an invention that was created from multiple ideas is the computer. Originally, computers were thought to be simple devices that could only do basic tasks like read and write. However, over time, various advancements were made to the computer and it became much more complex. This led to the creation of different types of computers today, which are used in almost every aspect of our lives.

How does brainstroming work?
Are you a morning person or an evening person? A night owl or a morning owl? How do you know which type of person your brainstroming is? Scientists have developed a way to measure the activity in the brainstem and it is based on what time of day someone is. This research has been published in "PLoS One" and was done by scientists at the University of Utah."
Brainstroming, also known as brainwave synchronization, is a process that occurs during sleep when different parts of the brain work together. Brainstroming helps to improve focus and concentration, make decisions faster, and achieve goals. The study found that people who are morning people tend to have more brainstroming than those who are evening people. People who are night owls also have more brainstroming than those who are morning owls.
