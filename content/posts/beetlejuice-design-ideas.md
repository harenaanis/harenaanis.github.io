Examples: What easy projects can you do with a few simple materials?
There are a few easy projects that you can do with some materials that you likely have on hand. Here are 5 examples:
1. Make a simple quilt. You could use a piece of fabric, a checkerboard, Rows and Columns fabric, or even a pieced fabric as the quilt top. Just be sure to choose a fabric that will look good when finished! 
2. Make an easy suspension bridge. This project is simple enough that you can do it with just about any material you have lying around the house. Cut some pieces of wood out of lumber and lay them across the bottom of your child’s play fort or sandbox to create the foundation for the bridge. Then just glue someWrap rope around each post and you’re ready to go! 
3. Build an easy rocking chair.
