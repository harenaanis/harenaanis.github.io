What can we do to prepare for 2020?
It has been announced that the United States will be leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2020. This decision is a result of the US president, Donald Trump, wanting to reduce trade deficits and increase economic growth. The main challenge for many countries planning for 2020 is how to prepare for this event. Here are some ideas to help: 
1. Make sure you have an idea of what your country’s trade deficit is. This information can be found on various websites or by talking to your business or government officials. 
2. Get involved in tariff debates with other countries. This can help you develop agreements that will protect your industry from new tariffs being placed by other countries. 
3. Do research on future trends in trade. By doing this, you will be able to identify any potential problems that may arise during the 2020 WTO membership negotiations.

Uses for inventions: What can you do with an invention?
Inventions offer a new way to do something, make a product or change the way we live. They can be helpful in many ways, from improving safety to solving problems we face every day. Sometimes an invention can be used for its own sake - like a new phone case that protects your phone - but other times an inventor might create an invention for a company or organization, hoping to improve their product or service. Here are some examples of how inventions have been used in the past: 
-An inventor created the first airbag system that saved lives on a highway in 1937.
-An inventor developed the global positioning system (GPS) in the 1990s so drivers could find their way around without having to look at Maps.
-Inventionists have created numerous devices and appliances since the turn of the century, such as solar chargers and anxiety pills.
